Else so thy cheek pays shame\\r\\n    When shrill-tongu\\'d Fulvia scolds. The messengers!\\r\\n  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\\r\\n    Of the rang\\'d empire fall! Here is my space.\\r\\n    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike\\r\\n    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life\\r\\n    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair\\r\\n    And such a twain can do\\'t, in which I bind,\\r\\n    On pain of punishment, the world to weet\\r\\n    We stand up peerless.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!\\r\\n    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?\\r\\n    I\\'ll seem the fool I am not. Antony\\r\\n    Will be himself.\\r\\n  ANTONY. But stirr\\'d by Cleopatra.\\r\\n    Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,\\r\\n    Let\\'s not confound the time with conference harsh;\\r\\n    There\\'s not a minute of our lives should stretch\\r\\n    Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!\\r\\n    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,\\r\\n    To weep; whose every passion fully strives\\r\\n    To make itself in thee fair and admir\\'d.\\r\\n    No messenger but thine, and all alone\\r\\n    To-night we\\'ll wander through the streets and note\\r\\n    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;\\r\\n    Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.\\r\\n                     Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train\\r\\n  DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz\\'d so slight?\\r\\n  PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,\\r\\n    He comes too short of that great property\\r\\n    Which still should go with Antony.\\r\\n  DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry\\r\\n    That he approves the common liar, who\\r\\n    Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope\\r\\n    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA\\'S palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost\\r\\n    most absolute Alexas, where\\'s the soothsayer that you prais\\'d so\\r\\n    to th\\' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must\\r\\n    charge his horns with garlands!\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is\\'t you, sir, that know things?\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. In nature\\'s infinite book of secrecy\\r\\n    A little I can read.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter ENOBARBUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough\\r\\n    Cleopatra\\'s health to drink.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.\\r\\n  IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Hush!\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to\\r\\n    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a\\r\\n    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to\\r\\n    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov\\'d a fairer former fortune\\r\\n    Than that which is to approach.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.\\r\\n    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,\\r\\n    And fertile every wish, a million.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. We\\'ll know all our fortunes.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-\\r\\n    drunk to bed.\\r\\n  IRAS. There\\'s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. E\\'en as the o\\'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.\\r\\n  IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I\\r\\n    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.\\r\\n  IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. I have said.\\r\\n  IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,\\r\\n    where would you choose it?\\r\\n  IRAS. Not in my husband\\'s nose.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his\\r\\n    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,\\r\\n    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a\\r\\n    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow\\r\\n    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear\\r\\n    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good\\r\\n    Isis, I beseech thee!\\r\\n  IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as\\r\\n    it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv\\'d, so it is\\r\\n    a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,\\r\\n    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Amen.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they\\r\\n    would make themselves whores but they\\'ld do\\'t!\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter CLEOPATRA\\r\\n\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. No, lady.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. No, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos\\'d to mirth; but on the sudden\\r\\n    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Madam?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where\\'s Alexas?\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.\\r\\n                       Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Ay.\\r\\n    But soon that war had end, and the time\\'s state\\r\\n    Made friends of them, jointing their force \\'gainst Caesar,\\r\\n    Whose better issue in the war from Italy\\r\\n    Upon the first encounter drave them.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Well, what worst?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.\\r\\n  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!\\r\\n    Things that are past are done with me. \\'Tis thus:\\r\\n    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,\\r\\n    I hear him as he flatter\\'d.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Labienus-\\r\\n    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force\\r\\n    Extended Asia from Euphrates,\\r\\n    His conquering banner shook from Syria\\r\\n    To Lydia and to Ionia,\\r\\n    Whilst-\\r\\n  ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. O, my lord!\\r\\n  ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;\\r\\n    Name Cleopatra as she is call\\'d in Rome.\\r\\n    Rail thou in Fulvia\\'s phrase, and taunt my faults\\r\\n    With such full licence as both truth and malice\\r\\n    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds\\r\\n    When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us\\r\\n    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit\\r\\n  ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!\\r\\n  FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?\\r\\n  SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Let him appear.\\r\\n    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,\\r\\n    Or lose myself in dotage.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter\\r\\n\\r\\n    What are you?\\r\\n  SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Where died she?\\r\\n  SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.\\r\\n    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious\\r\\n    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]\\r\\n  ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER\\r\\n    There\\'s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.\\r\\n    What our contempts doth often hurl from us\\r\\n    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,\\r\\n    By revolution low\\'ring, does become\\r\\n    The opposite of itself. She\\'s good, being gone;\\r\\n    The hand could pluck her back that shov\\'d her on.\\r\\n    I must from this enchanting queen break off.\\r\\n    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,\\r\\n    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Re-enter ENOBARBUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. What\\'s your pleasure, sir?\\r\\n  ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an\\r\\n    unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death\\'s the\\r\\n    word.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I must be gone.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity\\r\\n    to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great\\r\\n    cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but\\r\\n    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die\\r\\n    twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle\\r\\n    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a\\r\\n    celerity in dying.\\r\\n  ANTONY. She is cunning past man\\'s thought.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the\\r\\n    finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters\\r\\n    sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than\\r\\n    almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she\\r\\n    makes a show\\'r of rain as well as Jove.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of\\r\\n    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited\\r\\n    your travel.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Sir?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Dead.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it\\r\\n    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it\\r\\n    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that\\r\\n    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If\\r\\n    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,\\r\\n    and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown\\'d with\\r\\n    consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and\\r\\n    indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.\\r\\n  ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state\\r\\n    Cannot endure my absence.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach\\'d here cannot be\\r\\n    without you; especially that of Cleopatra\\'s, which wholly depends\\r\\n    on your abode.\\r\\n  ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers\\r\\n    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break\\r\\n    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,\\r\\n    And get her leave to part. For not alone\\r\\n    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,\\r\\n    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to\\r\\n    Of many our contriving friends in Rome\\r\\n    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius\\r\\n    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands\\r\\n    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,\\r\\n    Whose love is never link\\'d to the deserver\\r\\n    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw\\r\\n    Pompey the Great and all his dignities\\r\\n    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,\\r\\n    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up\\r\\n    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,\\r\\n    The sides o\\' th\\' world may danger. Much is breeding\\r\\n    Which, like the courser\\'s hair, hath yet but life\\r\\n    And not a serpent\\'s poison. Say our pleasure,\\r\\n    To such whose place is under us, requires\\r\\n    Our quick remove from hence.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I shall do\\'t.                                Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA\\'S palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Where is he?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who\\'s with him, what he does.\\r\\n    I did not send you. If you find him sad,\\r\\n    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report\\r\\n    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,\\r\\n    You do not hold the method to enforce\\r\\n    The like from him.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;\\r\\n    In time we hate that which we often fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Enter ANTONY\\r\\n\\r\\n    But here comes Antony.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.\\r\\n    It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature\\r\\n    Will not sustain it.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.\\r\\n  ANTONY. What\\'s the matter?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there\\'s some good news.\\r\\n    What says the married woman? You may go.\\r\\n    Would she had never given you leave to come!\\r\\n    Let her not say \\'tis I that keep you here-\\r\\n    I have no power upon you; hers you are.\\r\\n  ANTONY. The gods best know-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O, never was there queen\\r\\n    So mightily betray\\'d! Yet at the first\\r\\n    I saw the treasons planted.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Cleopatra-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,\\r\\n    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,\\r\\n    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,\\r\\n    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,\\r\\n    Which break themselves in swearing!\\r\\n  ANTONY. Most sweet queen-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,\\r\\n    But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,\\r\\n    Then was the time for words. No going then!\\r\\n    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,\\r\\n    Bliss in our brows\\' bent, none our parts so poor\\r\\n    But was a race of heaven. They are so still,\\r\\n    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,\\r\\n    Art turn\\'d the greatest liar.\\r\\n  ANTONY. How now, lady!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know\\r\\n    There were a heart in Egypt.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Hear me, queen:\\r\\n    The strong necessity of time commands\\r\\n    Our services awhile; but my full heart\\r\\n    Remains in use with you. Our Italy\\r\\n    Shines o\\'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius\\r\\n    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;\\r\\n    Equality of two domestic powers\\r\\n    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,\\r\\n    Are newly grown to love. The condemn\\'d Pompey,\\r\\n    Rich in his father\\'s honour, creeps apace\\r\\n    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived\\r\\n    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;\\r\\n    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge\\r\\n    By any desperate change. My more particular,\\r\\n    And that which most with you should safe my going,\\r\\n    Is Fulvia\\'s death.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,\\r\\n     It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?\\r\\n  ANTONY. She\\'s dead, my Queen.\\r\\n    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read\\r\\n    The garboils she awak\\'d. At the last, best.\\r\\n    See when and where she died.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O most false love!\\r\\n    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill\\r\\n    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,\\r\\n    In Fulvia\\'s death how mine receiv\\'d shall be.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar\\'d to know\\r\\n    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,\\r\\n    As you shall give th\\' advice. By the fire\\r\\n    That quickens Nilus\\' slime, I go from hence\\r\\n    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war\\r\\n    As thou affects.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!\\r\\n    But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-\\r\\n    So Antony loves.\\r\\n  ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,\\r\\n    And give true evidence to his love, which stands\\r\\n    An honourable trial.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.\\r\\n    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;\\r\\n    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears\\r\\n    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene\\r\\n    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look\\r\\n    Like perfect honour.\\r\\n  ANTONY. You\\'ll heat my blood; no more.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Now, by my sword-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;\\r\\n    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,\\r\\n    How this Herculean Roman does become\\r\\n    The carriage of his chafe.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I\\'ll leave you, lady.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.\\r\\n    Sir, you and I must part- but that\\'s not it.\\r\\n    Sir, you and I have lov\\'d- but there\\'s not it.\\r\\n    That you know well. Something it is I would-\\r\\n    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,\\r\\n    And I am all forgotten!\\r\\n  ANTONY. But that your royalty\\r\\n    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you\\r\\n    For idleness itself.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. \\'Tis sweating labour\\r\\n    To bear such idleness so near the heart\\r\\n    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;\\r\\n    Since my becomings kill me when they do not\\r\\n    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;\\r\\n    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,\\r\\n    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword\\r\\n    Sit laurel victory, and smooth success\\r\\n    Be strew\\'d before your feet!\\r\\n  ANTONY. Let us go. Come.\\r\\n    Our separation so abides and flies\\r\\n    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,\\r\\n    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.\\r\\n    Away!                                                 Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. Rome. CAESAR\\'S house\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\\r\\n    It is not Caesar\\'s natural vice to hate\\r\\n    Our great competitor. From Alexandria\\r\\n    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\\r\\n    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike\\r\\n    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\\r\\n    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\\r\\n    Vouchsaf\\'d to think he had partners. You shall find there\\r\\n    A man who is the abstract of all faults\\r\\n    That all men follow.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. I must not think there are\\r\\n    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.\\r\\n    His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,\\r\\n    More fiery by night\\'s blackness; hereditary\\r\\n    Rather than purchas\\'d; what he cannot change\\r\\n    Than what he chooses.\\r\\n  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let\\'s grant it is not\\r\\n    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\\r\\n    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\\r\\n    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\\r\\n    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\\r\\n    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-\\r\\n    As his composure must be rare indeed\\r\\n    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony\\r\\n    No way excuse his foils when we do bear\\r\\n    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill\\'d\\r\\n    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,\\r\\n    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones\\r\\n    Call on him for\\'t! But to confound such time\\r\\n    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud\\r\\n    As his own state and ours- \\'tis to be chid\\r\\n    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\\r\\n    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,\\r\\n    And so rebel to judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Here\\'s more news.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,\\r\\n    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\\r\\n    How \\'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\\r\\n    And it appears he is belov\\'d of those\\r\\n    That only have fear\\'d Caesar. To the ports\\r\\n    The discontents repair, and men\\'s reports\\r\\n    Give him much wrong\\'d.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I should have known no less.\\r\\n    It hath been taught us from the primal state\\r\\n    That he which is was wish\\'d until he were;\\r\\n    And the ebb\\'d man, ne\\'er lov\\'d till ne\\'er worth love,\\r\\n    Comes dear\\'d by being lack\\'d. This common body,\\r\\n    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\\r\\n    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\\r\\n    To rot itself with motion.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word\\r\\n    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\\r\\n    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\\r\\n    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\\r\\n    They make in Italy; the borders maritime\\r\\n    Lack blood to think on\\'t, and flush youth revolt.\\r\\n    No vessel can peep forth but \\'tis as soon\\r\\n    Taken as seen; for Pompey\\'s name strikes more\\r\\n    Than could his war resisted.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Antony,\\r\\n    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\\r\\n    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew\\'st\\r\\n    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\\r\\n    Did famine follow; whom thou fought\\'st against,\\r\\n    Though daintily brought up, with patience more\\r\\n    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\\r\\n    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle\\r\\n    Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\\r\\n    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;\\r\\n    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\\r\\n    The barks of trees thou brows\\'d. On the Alps\\r\\n    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,\\r\\n    Which some did die to look on. And all this-\\r\\n    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-\\r\\n    Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\\r\\n    So much as lank\\'d not.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. \\'Tis pity of him.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Let his shames quickly\\r\\n    Drive him to Rome. \\'Tis time we twain\\r\\n    Did show ourselves i\\' th\\' field; and to that end\\r\\n    Assemble we immediate council. Pompey\\r\\n    Thrives in our idleness.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,\\r\\n    I shall be furnish\\'d to inform you rightly\\r\\n    Both what by sea and land I can be able\\r\\n    To front this present time.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Till which encounter\\r\\n    It is my business too. Farewell.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime\\r\\n    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,\\r\\n    To let me be partaker.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;\\r\\n    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA\\'S palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Charmian!\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Madam?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!\\r\\n    Give me to drink mandragora.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time\\r\\n    My Antony is away.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O, \\'tis treason!\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!\\r\\n  MARDIAN. What\\'s your Highness\\' pleasure?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure\\r\\n    In aught an eunuch has. \\'Tis well for thee\\r\\n    That, being unseminar\\'d, thy freer thoughts\\r\\n    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?\\r\\n  MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Indeed?\\r\\n  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing\\r\\n    But what indeed is honest to be done.\\r\\n    Yet have I fierce affections, and think\\r\\n    What Venus did with Mars.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,\\r\\n    Where think\\'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?\\r\\n    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?\\r\\n    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\\r\\n    Do bravely, horse; for wot\\'st thou whom thou mov\\'st?\\r\\n    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\\r\\n    And burgonet of men. He\\'s speaking now,\\r\\n    Or murmuring \\'Where\\'s my serpent of old Nile?\\'\\r\\n    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself\\r\\n    With most delicious poison. Think on me,\\r\\n    That am with Phoebus\\' amorous pinches black,\\r\\n    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\\r\\n    When thou wast here above the ground, I was\\r\\n    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey\\r\\n    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;\\r\\n    There would he anchor his aspect and die\\r\\n    With looking on his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter ALEXAS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!\\r\\n    Yet, coming from him, that great med\\'cine hath\\r\\n    With his tinct gilded thee.\\r\\n    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,\\r\\n    He kiss\\'d- the last of many doubled kisses-\\r\\n    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. \\'Good friend,\\' quoth he\\r\\n    \\'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends\\r\\n    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,\\r\\n    To mend the petty present, I will piece\\r\\n    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,\\r\\n    Say thou, shall call her mistress.\\' So he nodded,\\r\\n    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,\\r\\n    Who neigh\\'d so high that what I would have spoke\\r\\n    Was beastly dumb\\'d by him.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Like to the time o\\' th\\' year between the extremes\\r\\n    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,\\r\\n    Note him, good Charmian; \\'tis the man; but note him!\\r\\n    He was not sad, for he would shine on those\\r\\n    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,\\r\\n    Which seem\\'d to tell them his remembrance lay\\r\\n    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.\\r\\n    O heavenly mingle! Be\\'st thou sad or merry,\\r\\n    The violence of either thee becomes,\\r\\n    So does it no man else. Met\\'st thou my posts?\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.\\r\\n    Why do you send so thick?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Who\\'s born that day\\r\\n    When I forget to send to Antony\\r\\n    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.\\r\\n    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,\\r\\n    Ever love Caesar so?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Be chok\\'d with such another emphasis!\\r\\n    Say \\'the brave Antony.\\'\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth\\r\\n    If thou with Caesar paragon again\\r\\n    My man of men.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,\\r\\n    I sing but after you.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. My salad days,\\r\\n    When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,\\r\\n    To say as I said then. But come, away!\\r\\n    Get me ink and paper.\\r\\n    He shall have every day a several greeting,\\r\\n    Or I\\'ll unpeople Egypt.                               Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II. SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY\\'S house\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner\\r\\n\\r\\n  POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist\\r\\n    The deeds of justest men.\\r\\n  MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,\\r\\n    That what they do delay they not deny.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays\\r\\n    The thing we sue for.\\r\\n  MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,\\r\\n    Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow\\'rs\\r\\n    Deny us for our good; so find we profit\\r\\n    By losing of our prayers.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I shall do well.\\r\\n    The people love me, and the sea is mine;\\r\\n    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope\\r\\n    Says it will come to th\\' full. Mark Antony\\r\\n    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make\\r\\n    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where\\r\\n    He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,\\r\\n    Of both is flatter\\'d; but he neither loves,\\r\\n    Nor either cares for him.\\r\\n  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus\\r\\n    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Where have you this? \\'Tis false.\\r\\n  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.\\r\\n  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,\\r\\n    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,\\r\\n    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan\\'d lip!\\r\\n    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;\\r\\n    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,\\r\\n    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks\\r\\n    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,\\r\\n    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour\\r\\n    Even till a Lethe\\'d dullness-\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter VARRIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n    How now, Varrius!\\r\\n  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:\\r\\n    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome\\r\\n    Expected. Since he went from Egypt \\'tis\\r\\n    A space for farther travel.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I could have given less matter\\r\\n    A better ear. Menas, I did not think\\r\\n    This amorous surfeiter would have donn\\'d his helm\\r\\n    For such a petty war; his soldiership\\r\\n    Is twice the other twain. But let us rear\\r\\n    The higher our opinion, that our stirring\\r\\n    Can from the lap of Egypt\\'s widow pluck\\r\\n    The ne\\'er-lust-wearied Antony.\\r\\n  MENAS. I cannot hope\\r\\n    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.\\r\\n    His wife that\\'s dead did trespasses to Caesar;\\r\\n    His brother warr\\'d upon him; although, I think,\\r\\n    Not mov\\'d by Antony.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I know not, Menas,\\r\\n    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.\\r\\n    Were\\'t not that we stand up against them all,\\r\\n    \\'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;\\r\\n    For they have entertained cause enough\\r\\n    To draw their swords. But how the fear of us\\r\\n    May cement their divisions, and bind up\\r\\n    The petty difference we yet not know.\\r\\n    Be\\'t as our gods will have\\'t! It only stands\\r\\n    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.\\r\\n    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, \\'tis a worthy deed,\\r\\n    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain\\r\\n    To soft and gentle speech.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him\\r\\n    To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,\\r\\n    Let Antony look over Caesar\\'s head\\r\\n    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,\\r\\n    Were I the wearer of Antonius\\' beard,\\r\\n    I would not shave\\'t to-day.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. \\'Tis not a time\\r\\n    For private stomaching.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Every time\\r\\n    Serves for the matter that is then born in\\'t.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;\\r\\n    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes\\r\\n    The noble Antony.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.\\r\\n\\r\\n            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.\\r\\n    Hark, Ventidius.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Noble friends,\\r\\n    That which combin\\'d us was most great, and let not\\r\\n    A leaner action rend us. What\\'s amiss,\\r\\n    May it be gently heard. When we debate\\r\\n    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit\\r\\n    Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,\\r\\n    The rather for I earnestly beseech,\\r\\n    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,\\r\\n    Nor curstness grow to th\\' matter.\\r\\n  ANTONY. \\'Tis spoken well.\\r\\n    Were we before our arinies, and to fight,\\r\\n    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]\\r\\n  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Thank you.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Sit.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Sit, sir.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]\\r\\n  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,\\r\\n    Or being, concern you not.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I must be laugh\\'d at\\r\\n    If, or for nothing or a little,\\r\\n    Should say myself offended, and with you\\r\\n    Chiefly i\\' the world; more laugh\\'d at that I should\\r\\n    Once name you derogately when to sound your name\\r\\n    It not concern\\'d me.\\r\\n  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,\\r\\n    What was\\'t to you?\\r\\n  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome\\r\\n    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there\\r\\n    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt\\r\\n    Might be my question.\\r\\n  ANTONY. How intend you- practis\\'d?\\r\\n  CAESAR. You may be pleas\\'d to catch at mine intent\\r\\n    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother\\r\\n    Made wars upon me, and their contestation\\r\\n    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.\\r\\n  ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never\\r\\n    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,\\r\\n    And have my learning from some true reports\\r\\n    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather\\r\\n    Discredit my authority with yours,\\r\\n    And make the wars alike against my stomach,\\r\\n    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters\\r\\n    Before did satisfy you. If you\\'ll patch a quarrel,\\r\\n    As matter whole you have not to make it with,\\r\\n    It must not be with this.\\r\\n  CAESAR. You praise yourself\\r\\n    By laying defects of judgment to me; but\\r\\n    You patch\\'d up your excuses.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Not so, not so;\\r\\n    I know you could not lack, I am certain on\\'t,\\r\\n    Very necessity of this thought, that I,\\r\\n    Your partner in the cause \\'gainst which he fought,\\r\\n    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars\\r\\n    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,\\r\\n    I would you had her spirit in such another!\\r\\n    The third o\\' th\\' world is yours, which with a snaffle\\r\\n    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to\\r\\n    wars with the women!\\r\\n  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,\\r\\n    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted\\r\\n    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant\\r\\n    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must\\r\\n    But say I could not help it.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I wrote to you\\r\\n    When rioting in Alexandria; you\\r\\n    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts\\r\\n    Did gibe my missive out of audience.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Sir,\\r\\n    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then\\r\\n    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want\\r\\n    Of what I was i\\' th\\' morning; but next day\\r\\n    I told him of myself, which was as much\\r\\n    As to have ask\\'d him pardon. Let this fellow\\r\\n    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,\\r\\n    Out of our question wipe him.\\r\\n  CAESAR. You have broken\\r\\n    The article of your oath, which you shall never\\r\\n    Have tongue to charge me with.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!\\r\\n  ANTONY. No;\\r\\n    Lepidus, let him speak.\\r\\n    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,\\r\\n    Supposing that I lack\\'d it. But on, Caesar:\\r\\n    The article of my oath-\\r\\n  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir\\'d them,\\r\\n    The which you both denied.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Neglected, rather;\\r\\n    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up\\r\\n    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,\\r\\n    I\\'ll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty\\r\\n    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\\r\\n    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,\\r\\n    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;\\r\\n    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do\\r\\n    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour\\r\\n    To stoop in such a case.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. \\'Tis noble spoken.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further\\r\\n    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite\\r\\n    Were to remember that the present need\\r\\n    Speaks to atone you.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another\\'s love for the instant,\\r\\n    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.\\r\\n    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to\\r\\n    do.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.\\r\\n  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!\\r\\n  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but\\r\\n    The manner of his speech; for\\'t cannot be\\r\\n    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions\\r\\n    So diff\\'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew\\r\\n    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge\\r\\n    O\\' th\\' world, I would pursue it.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother\\'s side,\\r\\n    Admir\\'d Octavia. Great Mark Antony\\r\\n    Is now a widower.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.\\r\\n    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof\\r\\n    Were well deserv\\'d of rashness.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear\\r\\n    Agrippa further speak.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,\\r\\n    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts\\r\\n    With an unslipping knot, take Antony\\r\\n    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims\\r\\n    No worse a husband than the best of men;\\r\\n    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak\\r\\n    That which none else can utter. By this marriage\\r\\n    All little jealousies, which now seem great,\\r\\n    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,\\r\\n    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,\\r\\n    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both\\r\\n    Would each to other, and all loves to both,\\r\\n    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;\\r\\n    For \\'tis a studied, not a present thought,\\r\\n    By duty ruminated.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?\\r\\n  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch\\'d\\r\\n    With what is spoke already.\\r\\n  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,\\r\\n    If I would say \\'Agrippa, be it so,\\'\\r\\n    To make this good?\\r\\n  CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and\\r\\n    His power unto Octavia.\\r\\n  ANTONY. May I never\\r\\n    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\\r\\n    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.\\r\\n    Further this act of grace; and from this hour\\r\\n    The heart of brothers govern in our loves\\r\\n    And sway our great designs!\\r\\n  CAESAR. There is my hand.\\r\\n    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother\\r\\n    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live\\r\\n    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never\\r\\n    Fly off our loves again!\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!\\r\\n  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword \\'gainst Pompey;\\r\\n    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great\\r\\n    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,\\r\\n    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;\\r\\n    At heel of that, defy him.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon\\'s.\\r\\n    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,\\r\\n    Or else he seeks out us.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Where lies he?\\r\\n  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.\\r\\n  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?\\r\\n  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea\\r\\n    He is an absolute master.\\r\\n  ANTONY. So is the fame.\\r\\n    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.\\r\\n    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\\r\\n    The business we have talk\\'d of.\\r\\n  CAESAR. With most gladness;\\r\\n    And do invite you to my sister\\'s view,\\r\\n    Whither straight I\\'ll lead you.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,\\r\\n    Not lack your company.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,\\r\\n    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]\\r\\n                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable\\r\\n    friend, Agrippa!\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!\\r\\n  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well\\r\\n    digested. You stay\\'d well by\\'t in Egypt.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made\\r\\n    the night light with drinking.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but\\r\\n    twelve persons there. Is this true?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more\\r\\n    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. She\\'s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs\\'d up his heart,\\r\\n    upon the river of Cydnus.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. There she appear\\'d indeed! Or my reporter devis\\'d well for\\r\\n    her.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.\\r\\n    The barge she sat in, like a burnish\\'d throne,\\r\\n    Burn\\'d on the water. The poop was beaten gold;\\r\\n    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that\\r\\n    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\\r\\n    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\\r\\n    The water which they beat to follow faster,\\r\\n    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\\r\\n    It beggar\\'d all description. She did lie\\r\\n    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,\\r\\n    O\\'erpicturing that Venus where we see\\r\\n    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her\\r\\n    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\\r\\n    With divers-colour\\'d fans, whose wind did seem\\r\\n    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\\r\\n    And what they undid did.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\\r\\n    So many mermaids, tended her i\\' th\\' eyes,\\r\\n    And made their bends adornings. At the helm\\r\\n    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle\\r\\n    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands\\r\\n    That yarely frame the office. From the barge\\r\\n    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense\\r\\n    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\\r\\n    Her people out upon her; and Antony,\\r\\n    Enthron\\'d i\\' th\\' market-place, did sit alone,\\r\\n    Whistling to th\\' air; which, but for vacancy,\\r\\n    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\\r\\n    And made a gap in nature.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,\\r\\n    Invited her to supper. She replied\\r\\n    It should be better he became her guest;\\r\\n    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,\\r\\n    Whom ne\\'er the word of \\'No\\' woman heard speak,\\r\\n    Being barber\\'d ten times o\\'er, goes to the feast,\\r\\n    And for his ordinary pays his heart\\r\\n    For what his eyes eat only.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!\\r\\n    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.\\r\\n    He ploughed her, and she cropp\\'d.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once\\r\\n    Hop forty paces through the public street;\\r\\n    And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,\\r\\n    That she did make defect perfection,\\r\\n    And, breathless, pow\\'r breathe forth.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.\\r\\n    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale\\r\\n    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy\\r\\n    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry\\r\\n    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things\\r\\n    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests\\r\\n    Bless her when she is riggish.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle\\r\\n    The heart of Antony, Octavia is\\r\\n    A blessed lottery to him.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Let us go.\\r\\n    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest\\r\\n    Whilst you abide here.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Rome. CAESAR\\'S house\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes\\r\\n    Divide me from your bosom.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. All which time\\r\\n    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers\\r\\n    To them for you.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,\\r\\n    Read not my blemishes in the world\\'s report.\\r\\n    I have not kept my square; but that to come\\r\\n    Shall all be done by th\\' rule. Good night, dear lady.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter SOOTHSAYER\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!\\r\\n  ANTONY. If you can- your reason.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but\\r\\n    yet hie you to Egypt again.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Say to me,\\r\\n    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar\\'s or mine?\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar\\'s.\\r\\n    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.\\r\\n    Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is\\r\\n    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,\\r\\n    Where Caesar\\'s is not; but near him thy angel\\r\\n    Becomes a fear, as being o\\'erpow\\'r\\'d. Therefore\\r\\n    Make space enough between you.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Speak this no more.\\r\\n  SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.\\r\\n    If thou dost play with him at any game,\\r\\n    Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck\\r\\n    He beats thee \\'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens\\r\\n    When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit\\r\\n    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;\\r\\n    But, he away, \\'tis noble.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Get thee gone.\\r\\n    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.\\r\\n                                                 Exit SOOTHSAYER\\r\\n    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,\\r\\n    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;\\r\\n    And in our sports my better cunning faints\\r\\n    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;\\r\\n    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,\\r\\n    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever\\r\\n    Beat mine, inhoop\\'d, at odds. I will to Egypt;\\r\\n    And though I make this marriage for my peace,\\r\\n    I\\' th\\' East my pleasure lies.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter VENTIDIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n    O, come, Ventidius,\\r\\n    You must to Parthia. Your commission\\'s ready;\\r\\n    Follow me and receive\\'t.                              Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. Rome. A street\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA\\r\\n\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten\\r\\n    Your generals after.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony\\r\\n    Will e\\'en but kiss Octavia, and we\\'ll follow.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier\\'s dress,\\r\\n    Which will become you both, farewell.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. We shall,\\r\\n    As I conceive the journey, be at th\\' Mount\\r\\n    Before you, Lepidus.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter;\\r\\n    My purposes do draw me much about.\\r\\n    You\\'ll win two days upon me.\\r\\n  BOTH. Sir, good success!\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA\\'S palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food\\r\\n    Of us that trade in love.\\r\\n  ALL. The music, ho!\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let\\'s to billiards. Come, Charmian.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play\\'d\\r\\n    As with a woman. Come, you\\'ll play with me, sir?\\r\\n  MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show\\'d, though\\'t come too short,\\r\\n    The actor may plead pardon. I\\'ll none now.\\r\\n    Give me mine angle- we\\'ll to th\\' river. There,\\r\\n    My music playing far off, I will betray\\r\\n    Tawny-finn\\'d fishes; my bended hook shall pierce\\r\\n    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up\\r\\n    I\\'ll think them every one an Antony,\\r\\n    And say \\'Ah ha! Y\\'are caught.\\'\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. \\'Twas merry when\\r\\n    You wager\\'d on your angling; when your diver\\r\\n    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he\\r\\n    With fervency drew up.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That time? O times\\r\\n    I laughed him out of patience; and that night\\r\\n    I laugh\\'d him into patience; and next morn,\\r\\n    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,\\r\\n    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst\\r\\n    I wore his sword Philippan.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n    O! from Italy?\\r\\n    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,\\r\\n    That long time have been barren.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Antony\\'s dead! If thou say so, villain,\\r\\n    Thou kill\\'st thy mistress; but well and free,\\r\\n    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here\\r\\n    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings\\r\\n    Have lipp\\'d, and trembled kissing.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Why, there\\'s more gold.\\r\\n    But, sirrah, mark, we use\\r\\n    To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,\\r\\n    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour\\r\\n    Down thy ill-uttering throat.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.\\r\\n    But there\\'s no goodness in thy face. If Antony\\r\\n    Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour\\r\\n    To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,\\r\\n    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown\\'d with snakes,\\r\\n    Not like a formal man.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Will\\'t please you hear me?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak\\'st.\\r\\n    Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,\\r\\n    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\\r\\n    I\\'ll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail\\r\\n    Rich pearls upon thee.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam, he\\'s well.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Well said.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Th\\'art an honest man.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. But yet, madam-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I do not like \\'but yet.\\' It does allay\\r\\n    The good precedence; fie upon \\'but yet\\'!\\r\\n    \\'But yet\\' is as a gaoler to bring forth\\r\\n    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\\r\\n    Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\\r\\n    The good and bad together. He\\'s friends with Caesar;\\r\\n    In state of health, thou say\\'st; and, thou say\\'st, free.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.\\r\\n    He\\'s bound unto Octavia.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. For the best turn i\\' th\\' bed.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam, he\\'s married to Octavia.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!\\r\\n                                              [Strikes him down]\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]\\r\\n    Horrible villain! or I\\'ll spurn thine eyes\\r\\n    Like balls before me; I\\'ll unhair thy head;\\r\\n                                     [She hales him up and down]\\r\\n    Thou shalt be whipp\\'d with wire and stew\\'d in brine,\\r\\n    Smarting in ling\\'ring pickle.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Gracious madam,\\r\\n    I that do bring the news made not the match.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Say \\'tis not so, a province I will give thee,\\r\\n    And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst\\r\\n    Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;\\r\\n    And I will boot thee with what gift beside\\r\\n    Thy modesty can beg.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. He\\'s married, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv\\'d too long.    [Draws a knife]\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Nay, then I\\'ll run.\\r\\n    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:\\r\\n    The man is innocent.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.\\r\\n    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures\\r\\n    Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.\\r\\n    Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. He is afear\\'d to come.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.\\r\\n    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike\\r\\n    A meaner than myself; since I myself\\r\\n    Have given myself the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Enter the MESSENGER again\\r\\n\\r\\n    Come hither, sir.\\r\\n    Though it be honest, it is never good\\r\\n    To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message\\r\\n    An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell\\r\\n    Themselves when they be felt.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Is he married?\\r\\n    I cannot hate thee worser than I do\\r\\n    If thou again say \\'Yes.\\'\\r\\n  MESSENGER. He\\'s married, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,\\r\\n    So half my Egypt were submerg\\'d and made\\r\\n    A cistern for scal\\'d snakes! Go, get thee hence.\\r\\n    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\\r\\n    Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. I crave your Highness\\' pardon.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He is married?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;\\r\\n    To punish me for what you make me do\\r\\n    Seems much unequal. He\\'s married to Octavia.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee\\r\\n    That art not what th\\'art sure of! Get thee hence.\\r\\n    The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\\r\\n    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,\\r\\n    And be undone by \\'em!                         Exit MESSENGER\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais\\'d Caesar.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for\\'t now. Lead me from hence,\\r\\n    I faint. O Iras, Charmian! \\'Tis no matter.\\r\\n    Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him\\r\\n    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,\\r\\n    Her inclination; let him not leave out\\r\\n    The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.\\r\\n                                                     Exit ALEXAS\\r\\n    Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-\\r\\n    Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\\r\\n    The other way\\'s a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]\\r\\n    Bid you Alexas\\r\\n    Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,\\r\\n    But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.        Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE VI. Near Misenum\\r\\n\\r\\nFlourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet; at\\r\\nanother, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIPPA, with\\r\\nsoldiers marching\\r\\n\\r\\n  POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;\\r\\n    And we shall talk before we fight.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Most meet\\r\\n    That first we come to words; and therefore have we\\r\\n    Our written purposes before us sent;\\r\\n    Which if thou hast considered, let us know\\r\\n    If \\'twill tie up thy discontented sword\\r\\n    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth\\r\\n    That else must perish here.\\r\\n  POMPEY. To you all three,\\r\\n    The senators alone of this great world,\\r\\n    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know\\r\\n    Wherefore my father should revengers want,\\r\\n    Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,\\r\\n    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\\r\\n    There saw you labouring for him. What was\\'t\\r\\n    That mov\\'d pale Cassius to conspire? and what\\r\\n    Made the all-honour\\'d honest Roman, Brutus,\\r\\n    With the arm\\'d rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,\\r\\n    To drench the Capitol, but that they would\\r\\n    Have one man but a man? And that is it\\r\\n    Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden\\r\\n    The anger\\'d ocean foams; with which I meant\\r\\n    To scourge th\\' ingratitude that despiteful Rome\\r\\n    Cast on my noble father.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Take your time.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;\\r\\n    We\\'ll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know\\'st\\r\\n    How much we do o\\'er-count thee.\\r\\n  POMPEY. At land, indeed,\\r\\n    Thou dost o\\'er-count me of my father\\'s house.\\r\\n    But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,\\r\\n    Remain in\\'t as thou mayst.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Be pleas\\'d to tell us-\\r\\n    For this is from the present- how you take\\r\\n    The offers we have sent you.\\r\\n  CAESAR. There\\'s the point.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh\\r\\n    What it is worth embrac\\'d.\\r\\n  CAESAR. And what may follow,\\r\\n    To try a larger fortune.\\r\\n  POMPEY. You have made me offer\\r\\n    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must\\r\\n    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send\\r\\n    Measures of wheat to Rome; this \\'greed upon,\\r\\n    To part with unhack\\'d edges and bear back\\r\\n    Our targes undinted.\\r\\n  ALL. That\\'s our offer.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Know, then,\\r\\n    I came before you here a man prepar\\'d\\r\\n    To take this offer; but Mark Antony\\r\\n    Put me to some impatience. Though I lose\\r\\n    The praise of it by telling, you must know,\\r\\n    When Caesar and your brother were at blows,\\r\\n    Your mother came to Sicily and did find\\r\\n    Her welcome friendly.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,\\r\\n    And am well studied for a liberal thanks\\r\\n    Which I do owe you.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Let me have your hand.\\r\\n    I did not think, sir, to have met you here.\\r\\n  ANTONY. The beds i\\' th\\' East are soft; and thanks to you,\\r\\n    That call\\'d me timelier than my purpose hither;\\r\\n    For I have gained by\\'t.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Since I saw you last\\r\\n    There is a change upon you.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Well, I know not\\r\\n    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;\\r\\n    But in my bosom shall she never come\\r\\n    To make my heart her vassal.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Well met here.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.\\r\\n    I crave our composition may be written,\\r\\n    And seal\\'d between us.\\r\\n  CAESAR. That\\'s the next to do.\\r\\n  POMPEY. We\\'ll feast each other ere we part, and let\\'s\\r\\n    Draw lots who shall begin.\\r\\n  ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.\\r\\n  POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;\\r\\n    But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery\\r\\n    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar\\r\\n    Grew fat with feasting there.\\r\\n  ANTONY. You have heard much.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.\\r\\n  ANTONY. And fair words to them.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Then so much have I heard;\\r\\n    And I have heard Apollodorus carried-\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.\\r\\n  POMPEY. What, I pray you?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far\\'st thou, soldier?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Well;\\r\\n    And well am like to do, for I perceive\\r\\n    Four feasts are toward.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand.\\r\\n    I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,\\r\\n    When I have envied thy behaviour.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Sir,\\r\\n    I never lov\\'d you much; but I ha\\' prais\\'d ye\\r\\n    When you have well deserv\\'d ten times as much\\r\\n    As I have said you did.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;\\r\\n    It nothing ill becomes thee.\\r\\n    Aboard my galley I invite you all.\\r\\n    Will you lead, lords?\\r\\n  ALL. Show\\'s the way, sir.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS\\r\\n  MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne\\'er have made this\\r\\n    treaty.- You and I have known, sir.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.\\r\\n  MENAS. We have, sir.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.\\r\\n  MENAS. And you by land.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it\\r\\n    cannot be denied what I have done by land.\\r\\n  MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you\\r\\n    have been a great thief by sea.\\r\\n  MENAS. And you by land.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,\\r\\n    Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two\\r\\n    thieves kissing.\\r\\n  MENAS. All men\\'s faces are true, whatsome\\'er their hands are.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.\\r\\n  MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.\\r\\n  MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn\\'d to a drinking.\\r\\n    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep\\'t back again.\\r\\n  MENAS. Y\\'have said, sir. We look\\'d not for Mark Antony here. Pray\\r\\n    you, is he married to Cleopatra?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Caesar\\' sister is call\\'d Octavia.\\r\\n  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.\\r\\n  MENAS. Pray ye, sir?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. \\'Tis true.\\r\\n  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not\\r\\n    prophesy so.\\r\\n  MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage\\r\\n    than the love of the parties.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems\\r\\n    to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of\\r\\n    their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.\\r\\n  MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He\\r\\n    will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia\\r\\n    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is\\r\\n    the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of\\r\\n    their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he\\r\\n    married but his occasion here.\\r\\n  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a\\r\\n    health for you.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us\\'d our throats in Egypt.\\r\\n  MENAS. Come, let\\'s away.                                Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT_2|SC_7\\r\\n                           SCENE VII.\\r\\n             On board POMPEY\\'S galley, off Misenum\\r\\n\\r\\n     Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet\\r\\n\\r\\n  FIRST SERVANT. Here they\\'ll be, man. Some o\\' their plants are\\r\\n    ill-rooted already; the least wind i\\' th\\' world will blow them\\r\\n    down.\\r\\n  SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour\\'d.\\r\\n  FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.\\r\\n  SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he\\r\\n    cries out \\'No more!\\'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself\\r\\n    to th\\' drink.\\r\\n  FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his\\r\\n    discretion.\\r\\n  SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men\\'s\\r\\n    fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service\\r\\n    as a partizan I could not heave.\\r\\n  FIRST SERVANT. To be call\\'d into a huge sphere, and not to be seen\\r\\n    to move in\\'t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully\\r\\n    disaster the cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n           A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,\\r\\n            POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,\\r\\n                         with other CAPTAINS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o\\' th\\'\\r\\n      Nile\\r\\n    By certain scales i\\' th\\' pyramid; they know\\r\\n    By th\\' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\\r\\n    Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells\\r\\n    The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman\\r\\n    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\\r\\n    And shortly comes to harvest.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Y\\'have strange serpents there.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the\\r\\n    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.\\r\\n  ANTONY. They are so.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I\\'ll ne\\'er out.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you\\'ll be in till\\r\\n    then.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies\\' pyramises are\\r\\n    very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.\\r\\n  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.\\r\\n  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is\\'t?\\r\\n  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,\\r\\n      Captain,\\r\\n    And hear me speak a word.\\r\\n  POMPEY. [ Whispers in\\'s ear ] Forbear me till anon-\\r\\n    This wine for Lepidus!\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. What manner o\\' thing is your crocodile?\\r\\n  ANTONY. It is shap\\'d, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it\\r\\n    hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own\\r\\n    organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements\\r\\n    once out of it, it transmigrates.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Of it own colour too.\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. \\'Tis a strange serpent.\\r\\n  ANTONY. \\'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?\\r\\n  ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very\\r\\n    epicure.\\r\\n  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!\\r\\n      Away!\\r\\n    Do as I bid you.- Where\\'s this cup I call\\'d for?\\r\\n  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear\\r\\n      me,\\r\\n    Rise from thy stool.\\r\\n  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th\\'art mad. [Rises and walks\\r\\n    aside] The matter?\\r\\n  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Thou hast serv\\'d me with much faith. What\\'s else to say?-\\r\\n    Be jolly, lords.\\r\\n  ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,\\r\\n    Keep off them, for you sink.\\r\\n  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?\\r\\n  POMPEY. What say\\'st thou?\\r\\n  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That\\'s twice.\\r\\n  POMPEY. How should that be?\\r\\n  MENAS. But entertain it,\\r\\n    And though you think me poor, I am the man\\r\\n    Will give thee all the world.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?\\r\\n  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.\\r\\n    Thou art, if thou dar\\'st be, the earthly Jove;\\r\\n    Whate\\'er the ocean pales or sky inclips\\r\\n    Is thine, if thou wilt ha\\'t.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Show me which way.\\r\\n  MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,\\r\\n    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;\\r\\n    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.\\r\\n    All there is thine.\\r\\n  POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,\\r\\n    And not have spoke on\\'t. In me \\'tis villainy:\\r\\n    In thee\\'t had been good service. Thou must know\\r\\n    \\'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:\\r\\n    Mine honour, it. Repent that e\\'er thy tongue\\r\\n    Hath so betray\\'d thine act. Being done unknown,\\r\\n    I should have found it afterwards well done,\\r\\n    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.\\r\\n  MENAS. [Aside] For this,\\r\\n    I\\'ll never follow thy pall\\'d fortunes more.\\r\\n    Who seeks, and will not take when once \\'tis offer\\'d,\\r\\n    Shall never find it more.\\r\\n  POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!\\r\\n  ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I\\'ll pledge it for him, Pompey.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Here\\'s to thee, Menas!\\r\\n  MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!\\r\\n  POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. There\\'s a strong fellow, Menas.\\r\\n               [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS]\\r\\n  MENAS. Why?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. \\'A bears the third part of the world, man; see\\'st not?\\r\\n  MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,\\r\\n    That it might go on wheels!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.\\r\\n  MENAS. Come.\\r\\n  POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.\\r\\n  ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!\\r\\n    Here\\'s to Caesar!\\r\\n  CAESAR. I could well forbear\\'t.\\r\\n    It\\'s monstrous labour when I wash my brain\\r\\n    And it grows fouler.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Be a child o\\' th\\' time.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Possess it, I\\'ll make answer.\\r\\n    But I had rather fast from all four days\\r\\n    Than drink so much in one.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!\\r\\n    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals\\r\\n    And celebrate our drink?\\r\\n  POMPEY. Let\\'s ha\\'t, good soldier.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Come, let\\'s all take hands,\\r\\n    Till that the conquering wine hath steep\\'d our sense\\r\\n    In soft and delicate Lethe.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. All take hands.\\r\\n    Make battery to our ears with the loud music,\\r\\n    The while I\\'ll place you; then the boy shall sing;\\r\\n    The holding every man shall bear as loud\\r\\n    As his strong sides can volley.\\r\\n               [Music plays.

What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,\\r\\n    Let me request you off; our graver business\\r\\n    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let\\'s part;\\r\\n    You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb\\r\\n    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue\\r\\n    Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost\\r\\n    Antick\\'d us all. What needs more words? Good night.\\r\\n    Good Antony, your hand.\\r\\n  POMPEY. I\\'ll try you on the shore.\\r\\n  ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give\\'s your hand.\\r\\n  POMPEY. O Antony,\\r\\n    You have my father\\'s house- but what? We are friends.\\r\\n    Come, down into the boat.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS.

Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now\\r\\n    Pleas\\'d fortune does of Marcus Crassus\\' death\\r\\n    Make me revenger. Bear the King\\'s son\\'s body\\r\\n    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,\\r\\n    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.\\r\\n  SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,\\r\\n    Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm\\r\\n    The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,\\r\\n    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither\\r\\n    The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,\\r\\n    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and\\r\\n    Put garlands on thy head.\\r\\n  VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,\\r\\n    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,\\r\\n    May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:\\r\\n    Better to leave undone than by our deed\\r\\n    Acquire too high a fame when him we serve\\'s away.\\r\\n    Caesar and Antony have ever won\\r\\n    More in their officer, than person. Sossius,\\r\\n    One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,\\r\\n    For quick accumulation of renown,\\r\\n    Which he achiev\\'d by th\\' minute, lost his favour.\\r\\n    Who does i\\' th\\' wars more than his captain can\\r\\n    Becomes his captain\\'s captain; and ambition,\\r\\n    The soldier\\'s virtue, rather makes choice of loss\\r\\n    Than gain which darkens him.\\r\\n    I could do more to do Antonius good,\\r\\n    But \\'twould offend him; and in his offence\\r\\n    Should my performance perish.\\r\\n  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that\\r\\n    Without the which a soldier and his sword\\r\\n    Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?\\r\\n  VENTIDIUS. I\\'ll humbly signify what in his name,\\r\\n    That magical word of war, we have effected;\\r\\n    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,\\r\\n    The ne\\'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia\\r\\n    We have jaded out o\\' th\\' field.\\r\\n  SILIUS. Where is he now?\\r\\n  VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste\\r\\n    The weight we must convey with\\'s will permit,\\r\\n    We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.\\r\\n                                                          Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT_3|SC_2\\r\\n                            SCENE II.

They have dispatch\\'d with Pompey; he is gone;\\r\\n    The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps\\r\\n    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,\\r\\n    Since Pompey\\'s feast, as Menas says, is troubled\\r\\n    With the green sickness.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. \\'Tis a noble Lepidus.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he\\'s the Jupiter of men.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. What\\'s Antony? The god of Jupiter.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say \\'Caesar\\'- go no further.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.\\r\\n    Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot\\r\\n    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-\\r\\n    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,\\r\\n    Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Both he loves.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets\\r\\n      within] So-\\r\\n    This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. No further, sir.\\r\\n  CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself;\\r\\n    Use me well in\\'t. Sister, prove such a wife\\r\\n    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band\\r\\n    Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,\\r\\n    Let not the piece of virtue which is set\\r\\n    Betwixt us as the cement of our love\\r\\n    To keep it builded be the ram to batter\\r\\n    The fortress of it; for better might we\\r\\n    Have lov\\'d without this mean, if on both parts\\r\\n    This be not cherish\\'d.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Make me not offended\\r\\n    In your distrust.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I have said.\\r\\n  ANTONY. You shall not find,\\r\\n    Though you be therein curious, the least cause\\r\\n    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,\\r\\n    And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!\\r\\n    We will here part.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.\\r\\n    The elements be kind to thee and make\\r\\n    Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. My noble brother!\\r\\n  ANTONY. The April\\'s in her eyes. It is love\\'s spring,\\r\\n    And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband\\'s house; and-\\r\\n  CAESAR. What, Octavia?\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. I\\'ll tell you in your ear.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can\\r\\n    Her heart inform her tongue- the swan\\'s down feather,\\r\\n    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,\\r\\n    And neither way inclines.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in\\'s face.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a\\r\\n      horse;\\r\\n    So is he, being a man.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,\\r\\n    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,\\r\\n    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept\\r\\n    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled\\r\\n      with a rheum;\\r\\n    What willingly he did confound he wail\\'d,\\r\\n    Believe\\'t- till I weep too.\\r\\n  CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia,\\r\\n    You shall hear from me still; the time shall not\\r\\n    Out-go my thinking on you.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Come, sir, come;\\r\\n    I\\'ll wrestle with you in my strength of love.\\r\\n    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,\\r\\n    And give you to the gods.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!\\r\\n  LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light\\r\\n    To thy fair way!\\r\\n  CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]\\r\\n  ANTONY.

Go to, go to.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter the MESSENGER as before\\r\\n\\r\\n    Come hither, sir.\\r\\n  ALEXAS. Good Majesty,\\r\\n    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you\\r\\n    But when you are well pleas\\'d.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That Herod\\'s head\\r\\n    I\\'ll have. But how, when Antony is gone,\\r\\n    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Where?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome\\r\\n    I look\\'d her in the face, and saw her led\\r\\n    Between her brother and Mark Antony.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu\\'d or low?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic\\'d.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That\\'s not so good. He cannot like her long.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! \\'tis impossible.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!\\r\\n    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,\\r\\n    If e\\'er thou look\\'dst on majesty.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. She creeps.\\r\\n    Her motion and her station are as one;\\r\\n    She shows a body rather than a life,\\r\\n    A statue than a breather.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt\\r\\n    Cannot make better note.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He\\'s very knowing;\\r\\n    I do perceive\\'t. There\\'s nothing in her yet.\\r\\n    The fellow has good judgment.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Excellent.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Madam,\\r\\n    She was a widow.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!\\r\\n  MESSENGER. And I do think she\\'s thirty.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Bear\\'st thou her face in mind? Is\\'t long or round?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.\\r\\n    Her hair, what colour?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead\\r\\n    As low as she would wish it.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. There\\'s gold for thee.\\r\\n    Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.\\r\\n    I will employ thee back again; I find thee\\r\\n    Most fit for business.

I repent me much\\r\\n    That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,\\r\\n    This creature\\'s no such thing.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,\\r\\n    And serving you so long!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.\\r\\n    But \\'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me\\r\\n    Where I will write. All may be well enough.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN.

Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-\\r\\n    That were excusable, that and thousands more\\r\\n    Of semblable import- but he hath wag\\'d\\r\\n    New wars \\'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it\\r\\n    To public ear;\\r\\n    Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not\\r\\n    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly\\r\\n    He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;\\r\\n    When the best hint was given him, he not took\\'t,\\r\\n    Or did it from his teeth.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. O my good lord,\\r\\n    Believe not all; or if you must believe,\\r\\n    Stomach not all.

Gentle Octavia,\\r\\n    Let your best love draw to that point which seeks\\r\\n    Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,\\r\\n    I lose myself; better I were not yours\\r\\n    Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,\\r\\n    Yourself shall go between\\'s.

Caesar, having made use of him in the wars \\'gainst Pompey,\\r\\n    presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the\\r\\n    glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters\\r\\n    he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.\\r\\n    So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;\\r\\n    And throw between them all the food thou hast,\\r\\n    They\\'ll grind the one the other. Where\\'s Antony?\\r\\n  EROS. He\\'s walking in the garden- thus, and spurns\\r\\n    The rush that lies before him; cries \\'Fool Lepidus!\\'\\r\\n    And threats the throat of that his officer\\r\\n    That murd\\'red Pompey.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS.

Unto her\\r\\n    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her\\r\\n    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,\\r\\n    Absolute queen.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. This in the public eye?\\r\\n  CAESAR. I\\' th\\' common show-place, where they exercise.\\r\\n    His sons he there proclaim\\'d the kings of kings:\\r\\n    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,\\r\\n    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign\\'d\\r\\n    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She\\r\\n    In th\\' habiliments of the goddess Isis\\r\\n    That day appear\\'d; and oft before gave audience,\\r\\n    As \\'tis reported, so.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus\\r\\n    Inform\\'d.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence\\r\\n    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.\\r\\n  CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv\\'d\\r\\n    His accusations.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?\\r\\n  CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily\\r\\n    Sextus Pompeius spoil\\'d, we had not rated him\\r\\n    His part o\\' th\\' isle. Then does he say he lent me\\r\\n    Some shipping, unrestor\\'d. Lastly, he frets\\r\\n    That Lepidus of the triumvirate\\r\\n    Should be depos\\'d; and, being, that we detain\\r\\n    All his revenue.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer\\'d.\\r\\n  CAESAR. \\'Tis done already, and messenger gone.\\r\\n    I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,\\r\\n    That he his high authority abus\\'d,\\r\\n    And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer\\'d\\r\\n    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia\\r\\n    And other of his conquer\\'d kingdoms,\\r\\n    Demand the like.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. He\\'ll never yield to that.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter OCTAVIA, with her train\\r\\n\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!\\r\\n  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. You have not call\\'d me so, nor have you cause.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Why have you stol\\'n upon us thus? You come not\\r\\n    Like Caesar\\'s sister. The wife of Antony\\r\\n    Should have an army for an usher, and\\r\\n    The neighs of horse to tell of her approach\\r\\n    Long ere she did appear. The trees by th\\' way\\r\\n    Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,\\r\\n    Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust\\r\\n    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,\\r\\n    Rais\\'d by your populous troops. But you are come\\r\\n    A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented\\r\\n    The ostentation of our love, which left unshown\\r\\n    Is often left unlov\\'d. We should have met you\\r\\n    By sea and land, supplying every stage\\r\\n    With an augmented greeting.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,\\r\\n    To come thus was I not constrain\\'d, but did it\\r\\n    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,\\r\\n    Hearing that you prepar\\'d for war, acquainted\\r\\n    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg\\'d\\r\\n    His pardon for return.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Which soon he granted,\\r\\n    Being an obstruct \\'tween his lust and him.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.\\r\\n  CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,\\r\\n    And his affairs come to me on the wind.\\r\\n    Where is he now?\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.\\r\\n  CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra\\r\\n    Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire\\r\\n    Up to a whore, who now are levying\\r\\n    The kings o\\' th\\' earth for war. He hath assembled\\r\\n    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus\\r\\n    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king\\r\\n    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;\\r\\n    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;\\r\\n    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king\\r\\n    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,\\r\\n    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with\\r\\n    More larger list of sceptres.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,\\r\\n    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,\\r\\n    That does afflict each other!\\r\\n  CAESAR. Welcome hither.\\r\\n    Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,\\r\\n    Till we perceiv\\'d both how you were wrong led\\r\\n    And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;\\r\\n    Be you not troubled with the time, which drives\\r\\n    O\\'er your content these strong necessities,\\r\\n    But let determin\\'d things to destiny\\r\\n    Hold unbewail\\'d their way. Welcome to Rome;\\r\\n    Nothing more dear to me. You are abus\\'d\\r\\n    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,\\r\\n    To do you justice, make their ministers\\r\\n    Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,\\r\\n    And ever welcome to us.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.\\r\\n    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;\\r\\n    Only th\\' adulterous Antony, most large\\r\\n    In his abominations, turns you off,\\r\\n    And gives his potent regiment to a trull\\r\\n    That noises it against us.\\r\\n  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?\\r\\n  CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you\\r\\n    Be ever known to patience. My dear\\'st sister!

I will be even with thee, doubt it not.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. But why, why,\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,\\r\\n    And say\\'st it is not fit.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Is\\'t not denounc\\'d against us? Why should not we\\r\\n    Be there in person?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:\\r\\n    If we should serve with horse and mares together\\r\\n    The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear\\r\\n    A soldier and his horse.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What is\\'t you say?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;\\r\\n    Take from his heart, take from his brain, from\\'s time,\\r\\n    What should not then be spar\\'d. He is already\\r\\n    Traduc\\'d for levity; and \\'tis said in Rome\\r\\n    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids\\r\\n    Manage this war.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot\\r\\n    That speak against us! A charge we bear i\\' th\\' war,\\r\\n    And, as the president of my kingdom, will\\r\\n    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;\\r\\n    I will not stay behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.\\r\\n    Here comes the Emperor.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,\\r\\n    That from Tarentum and Brundusium\\r\\n    He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,\\r\\n    And take in Toryne?- You have heard on\\'t, sweet?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir\\'d\\r\\n    Than by the negligent.\\r\\n  ANTONY. A good rebuke,\\r\\n    Which might have well becom\\'d the best of men\\r\\n    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we\\r\\n    Will fight with him by sea.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?\\r\\n  ANTONY. For that he dares us to\\'t.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar\\'d him to single fight.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,\\r\\n    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,\\r\\n    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;\\r\\n    And so should you.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann\\'d;\\r\\n    Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people\\r\\n    Ingross\\'d by swift impress. In Caesar\\'s fleet\\r\\n    Are those that often have \\'gainst Pompey fought;\\r\\n    Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace\\r\\n    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,\\r\\n    Being prepar\\'d for land.\\r\\n  ANTONY. By sea, by sea.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away\\r\\n    The absolute soldiership you have by land;\\r\\n    Distract your army, which doth most consist\\r\\n    Of war-mark\\'d footmen; leave unexecuted\\r\\n    Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo\\r\\n    The way which promises assurance; and\\r\\n    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard\\r\\n    From firm security.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I\\'ll fight at sea.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,\\r\\n    And, with the rest full-mann\\'d, from th\\' head of Actium\\r\\n    Beat th\\' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,\\r\\n    We then can do\\'t at land.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n    Thy business?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;\\r\\n    Caesar has taken Toryne.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Can he be there in person? \\'Tis impossible-\\r\\n    Strange that his power should be. Canidius,\\r\\n    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,\\r\\n    And our twelve thousand horse. We\\'ll to our ship.\\r\\n    Away, my Thetis!\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter a SOLDIER\\r\\n\\r\\n    How now, worthy soldier?\\r\\n  SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;\\r\\n    Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt\\r\\n    This sword and these my wounds? Let th\\' Egyptians\\r\\n    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we\\r\\n    Have us\\'d to conquer standing on the earth\\r\\n    And fighting foot to foot.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Well, well- away.\\r\\n                         Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS\\r\\n  SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i\\' th\\' right.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows\\r\\n    Not in the power on\\'t. So our leader\\'s led,\\r\\n    And we are women\\'s men.\\r\\n  SOLDIER. You keep by land\\r\\n    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,\\r\\n    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;\\r\\n    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar\\'s\\r\\n    Carries beyond belief.\\r\\n  SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,\\r\\n    His power went out in such distractions as\\r\\n    Beguil\\'d all spies.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Who\\'s his lieutenant, hear you?\\r\\n  SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS.

Taurus!\\r\\n  TAURUS. My lord?\\r\\n  CAESAR. Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle\\r\\n    Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed\\r\\n    The prescript of this scroll.

Gods and goddesses,\\r\\n    All the whole synod of them!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. What\\'s thy passion?\\r\\n  SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost\\r\\n    With very ignorance; we have kiss\\'d away\\r\\n    Kingdoms and provinces.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?\\r\\n  SCARUS. On our side like the token\\'d pestilence,\\r\\n    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-\\r\\n    Whom leprosy o\\'ertake!- i\\' th\\' midst o\\' th\\' fight,\\r\\n    When vantage like a pair of twins appear\\'d,\\r\\n    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-\\r\\n    The breese upon her, like a cow in June-\\r\\n    Hoists sails and flies.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;\\r\\n    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not\\r\\n    Endure a further view.\\r\\n  SCARUS. She once being loof\\'d,\\r\\n    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,\\r\\n    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,\\r\\n    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.\\r\\n    I never saw an action of such shame;\\r\\n    Experience, manhood, honour, ne\\'er before\\r\\n    Did violate so itself.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter CANIDIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,\\r\\n    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general\\r\\n    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.\\r\\n    O, he has given example for our flight\\r\\n    Most grossly by his own!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?\\r\\n    Why then, good night indeed.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.\\r\\n  SCARUS. \\'Tis easy to\\'t; and there I will attend\\r\\n    What further comes.\\r\\n  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render\\r\\n    My legions and my horse; six kings already\\r\\n    Show me the way of yielding.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS.

I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards\\r\\n    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;\\r\\n    I have myself resolv\\'d upon a course\\r\\n    Which has no need of you; be gone.\\r\\n    My treasure\\'s in the harbour, take it.

For Antony,\\r\\n    I have no ears to his request. The Queen\\r\\n    Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she\\r\\n    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,\\r\\n    Or take his life there.

CLEOPATRA\\'S palace\\r\\n\\r\\n        Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will\\r\\n    Lord of his reason. What though you fled\\r\\n    From that great face of war, whose several ranges\\r\\n    Frighted each other? Why should he follow?\\r\\n    The itch of his affection should not then\\r\\n    Have nick\\'d his captainship, at such a point,\\r\\n    When half to half the world oppos\\'d, he being\\r\\n    The mered question. \\'Twas a shame no less\\r\\n    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags\\r\\n    And leave his navy gazing.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. Is that his answer?\\r\\n  EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.\\r\\n  ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she\\r\\n    Will yield us up.\\r\\n  EUPHRONIUS. He says so.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Let her know\\'t.\\r\\n    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\\r\\n    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim\\r\\n    With principalities.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?\\r\\n  ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose\\r\\n    Of youth upon him; from which the world should note\\r\\n    Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,\\r\\n    May be a coward\\'s whose ministers would prevail\\r\\n    Under the service of a child as soon\\r\\n    As i\\' th\\' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore\\r\\n    To lay his gay comparisons apart,\\r\\n    And answer me declin\\'d, sword against sword,\\r\\n    Ourselves alone. I\\'ll write it. Follow me.\\r\\n                                    Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS\\r\\n  EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will\\r\\n    Unstate his happiness, and be stag\\'d to th\\' show\\r\\n    Against a sworder! I see men\\'s judgments are\\r\\n    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward\\r\\n    Do draw the inward quality after them,\\r\\n    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,\\r\\n    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will\\r\\n    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu\\'d\\r\\n    His judgment too.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter a SERVANT\\r\\n\\r\\n  SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!\\r\\n    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose\\r\\n    That kneel\\'d unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.\\r\\n    The loyalty well held to fools does make\\r\\n    Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure\\r\\n    To follow with allegiance a fall\\'n lord\\r\\n    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,\\r\\n    And earns a place i\\' th\\' story.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter THYREUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Caesar\\'s will?\\r\\n  THYREUS. Hear it apart.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.\\r\\n  THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,\\r\\n    Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master\\r\\n    Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know\\r\\n    Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar\\'s.\\r\\n  THYREUS. So.\\r\\n    Thus then, thou most renown\\'d: Caesar entreats\\r\\n    Not to consider in what case thou stand\\'st\\r\\n    Further than he is Caesar.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!\\r\\n  THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony\\r\\n    As you did love, but as you fear\\'d him.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O!\\r\\n  THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he\\r\\n    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,\\r\\n    Not as deserv\\'d.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows\\r\\n    What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,\\r\\n    But conquer\\'d merely.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,\\r\\n    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky\\r\\n    That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for\\r\\n    Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit\\r\\n  THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar\\r\\n    What you require of him? For he partly begs\\r\\n    To be desir\\'d to give. It much would please him\\r\\n    That of his fortunes you should make a staff\\r\\n    To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits\\r\\n    To hear from me you had left Antony,\\r\\n    And put yourself under his shroud,\\r\\n    The universal landlord.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What\\'s your name?\\r\\n  THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,\\r\\n    Say to great Caesar this: in deputation\\r\\n    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt\\r\\n    To lay my crown at \\'s feet, and there to kneel.\\r\\n    Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear\\r\\n    The doom of Egypt.\\r\\n  THYREUS. \\'Tis your noblest course.\\r\\n    Wisdom and fortune combating together,\\r\\n    If that the former dare but what it can,\\r\\n    No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay\\r\\n    My duty on your hand.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar\\'s father oft,\\r\\n    When he hath mus\\'d of taking kingdoms in,\\r\\n    Bestow\\'d his lips on that unworthy place,\\r\\n    As it rain\\'d kisses.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!\\r\\n    What art thou, fellow?\\r\\n  THYREUS. One that but performs\\r\\n    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest\\r\\n    To have command obey\\'d.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!\\r\\n    Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried \\'Ho!\\'\\r\\n    Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth\\r\\n    And cry \\'Your will?\\' Have you no ears? I am\\r\\n    Antony yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter servants\\r\\n\\r\\n    Take hence this Jack and whip him.\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. \\'Tis better playing with a lion\\'s whelp\\r\\n    Than with an old one dying.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Moon and stars!\\r\\n    Whip him. Were\\'t twenty of the greatest tributaries\\r\\n    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\\r\\n    So saucy with the hand of she here- what\\'s her name\\r\\n    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\\r\\n    Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,\\r\\n    And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.\\r\\n  THYMUS. Mark Antony-\\r\\n  ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,\\r\\n    Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar\\'s shall\\r\\n    Bear us an errand to him.       Exeunt servants with THYREUS\\r\\n    You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!\\r\\n    Have I my pillow left unpress\\'d in Rome,\\r\\n    Forborne the getting of a lawful race,\\r\\n    And by a gem of women, to be abus\\'d\\r\\n    By one that looks on feeders?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Good my lord-\\r\\n  ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.\\r\\n    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-\\r\\n    O misery on\\'t!- the wise gods seel our eyes,\\r\\n    In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us\\r\\n    Adore our errors, laugh at\\'s while we strut\\r\\n    To our confusion.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O, is\\'t come to this?\\r\\n  ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon\\r\\n    Dead Caesar\\'s trencher. Nay, you were a fragment\\r\\n    Of Cneius Pompey\\'s, besides what hotter hours,\\r\\n    Unregist\\'red in vulgar fame, you have\\r\\n    Luxuriously pick\\'d out; for I am sure,\\r\\n    Though you can guess what temperance should be,\\r\\n    You know not what it is.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?\\r\\n  ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,\\r\\n    And say \\'God quit you!\\' be familiar with\\r\\n    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal\\r\\n    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were\\r\\n    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar\\r\\n    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,\\r\\n    And to proclaim it civilly were like\\r\\n    A halter\\'d neck which does the hangman thank\\r\\n    For being yare about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS\\r\\n\\r\\n    Is he whipt?\\r\\n  SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Cried he? and begg\\'d \\'a pardon?\\r\\n  SERVANT. He did ask favour.\\r\\n  ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent\\r\\n    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\\r\\n    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since\\r\\n    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth\\r\\n    The white hand of a lady fever thee!\\r\\n    Shake thou to look on\\'t. Get thee back to Caesar;\\r\\n    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say\\r\\n    He makes me angry with him; for he seems\\r\\n    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\\r\\n    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;\\r\\n    And at this time most easy \\'tis to do\\'t,\\r\\n    When my good stars, that were my former guides,\\r\\n    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires\\r\\n    Into th\\' abysm of hell. If he mislike\\r\\n    My speech and what is done, tell him he has\\r\\n    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\\r\\n    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,\\r\\n    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.\\r\\n    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon\\r\\n    Is now eclips\\'d, and it portends alone\\r\\n    The fall of Antony.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.\\r\\n  ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\\r\\n    With one that ties his points?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,\\r\\n    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,\\r\\n    And poison it in the source, and the first stone\\r\\n    Drop in my neck; as it determines, so\\r\\n    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!\\r\\n    Till by degrees the memory of my womb,\\r\\n    Together with my brave Egyptians all,\\r\\n    By the discandying of this pelleted storm,\\r\\n    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile\\r\\n    Have buried them for prey.\\r\\n  ANTONY. I am satisfied.\\r\\n    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where\\r\\n    I will oppose his fate. Our force by land\\r\\n    Hath nobly held; our sever\\'d navy to\\r\\n    Have knit again, and fleet, threat\\'ning most sea-like.\\r\\n    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\\r\\n    If from the field I shall return once more\\r\\n    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.\\r\\n    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.\\r\\n    There\\'s hope in\\'t yet.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. That\\'s my brave lord!\\r\\n  ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew\\'d, hearted, breath\\'d,\\r\\n    And fight maliciously. For when mine hours\\r\\n    Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\\r\\n    Of me for jests; but now I\\'ll set my teeth,\\r\\n    And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\\r\\n    Let\\'s have one other gaudy night. Call to me\\r\\n    All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;\\r\\n    Let\\'s mock the midnight bell.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.\\r\\n    I had thought t\\'have held it poor; but since my lord\\r\\n    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.\\r\\n  ANTONY. We will yet do well.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Do so, we\\'ll speak to them; and to-night I\\'ll force\\r\\n    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,\\r\\n    There\\'s sap in\\'t yet. The next time I do fight\\r\\n    I\\'ll make death love me; for I will contend\\r\\n    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. Now he\\'ll outstare the lightning. To be furious\\r\\n    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood\\r\\n    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still\\r\\n    A diminution in our captain\\'s brain\\r\\n    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,\\r\\n    It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek\\r\\n    Some way to leave him.

He calls me boy, and chides as he had power\\r\\n    To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger\\r\\n    He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,\\r\\n    Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know\\r\\n    I have many other ways to die, meantime\\r\\n    Laugh at his challenge.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. Caesar must think\\r\\n    When one so great begins to rage, he\\'s hunted\\r\\n    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now\\r\\n    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger\\r\\n    Made good guard for itself.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Let our best heads\\r\\n    Know that to-morrow the last of many battles\\r\\n    We mean to fight. Within our files there are\\r\\n    Of those that serv\\'d Mark Antony but late\\r\\n    Enough to fetch him in.

He will not fight with me, Domitius?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. No.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Why should he not?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,\\r\\n    He is twenty men to one.\\r\\n  ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,\\r\\n    By sea and land I\\'ll fight. Or I will live,\\r\\n    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood\\r\\n    Shall make it live again. Woo\\'t thou fight well?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. I\\'ll strike, and cry \\'Take all.\\'\\r\\n  ANTONY. Well said; come on.\\r\\n    Call forth my household servants; let\\'s to-night\\r\\n    Be bounteous at our meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter three or four servitors\\r\\n\\r\\n    Give me thy hand,\\r\\n    Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;\\r\\n    Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv\\'d me well,\\r\\n    And kings have been your fellows.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] \\'Tis one of those odd tricks which\\r\\n      sorrow shoots\\r\\n    Out of the mind.\\r\\n  ANTONY. And thou art honest too.\\r\\n    I wish I could be made so many men,\\r\\n    And all of you clapp\\'d up together in\\r\\n    An Antony, that I might do you service\\r\\n    So good as you have done.\\r\\n  SERVANT.

Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.\\r\\n    Scant not my cups, and make as much of me\\r\\n    As when mine empire was your fellow too,\\r\\n    And suffer\\'d my command.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?\\r\\n    ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Tend me to-night;\\r\\n    May be it is the period of your duty.\\r\\n    Haply you shall not see me more; or if,\\r\\n    A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow\\r\\n    You\\'ll serve another master. I look on you\\r\\n    As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,\\r\\n    I turn you not away; but, like a master\\r\\n    Married to your good service, stay till death.\\r\\n    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,\\r\\n    And the gods yield you for\\'t!\\r\\n  ENOBARBUS.

Eros,\\r\\n    Wouldst thou be window\\'d in great Rome and see\\r\\n    Thy master thus with pleach\\'d arms, bending down\\r\\n    His corrigible neck, his face subdu\\'d\\r\\n    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel\\'d seat\\r\\n    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded\\r\\n    His baseness that ensued?\\r\\n  EROS. I would not see\\'t.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur\\'d.\\r\\n    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn\\r\\n    Most useful for thy country.\\r\\n  EROS. O, sir, pardon me!\\r\\n  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor\\'st thou not then\\r\\n    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,\\r\\n    Or thy precedent services are all\\r\\n    But accidents unpurpos\\'d. Draw, and come.\\r\\n  EROS.

My sword is drawn.\\r\\n  ANTONY. Then let it do at once\\r\\n    The thing why thou hast drawn it.\\r\\n  EROS. My dear master,\\r\\n    My captain and my emperor, let me say,\\r\\n    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.\\r\\n  ANTONY. \\'Tis said, man; and farewell.\\r\\n  EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?\\r\\n  ANTONY. Now, Eros.\\r\\n  EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow\\r\\n    Of Antony\\'s death.                            [Kills himself\\r\\n  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!\\r\\n    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what\\r\\n    I should, and thou couldst not.

But I will be\\r\\n    A bridegroom in my death, and run into\\'t\\r\\n    As to a lover\\'s bed. Come, then; and, Eros,\\r\\n    Thy master dies thy scholar.

She had a prophesying fear\\r\\n    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-\\r\\n    Which never shall be found- you did suspect\\r\\n    She had dispos\\'d with Caesar, and that your rage\\r\\n    Would not be purg\\'d, she sent you word she was dead;\\r\\n    But fearing since how it might work, hath sent\\r\\n    Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,\\r\\n    I dread, too late.\\r\\n  ANTONY.

Peace!\\r\\n    Not Caesar\\'s valour hath o\\'erthrown Antony,\\r\\n    But Antony\\'s hath triumph\\'d on itself.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony\\r\\n    Should conquer Antony; but woe \\'tis so!\\r\\n  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only\\r\\n    I here importune death awhile, until\\r\\n    Of many thousand kisses the poor last\\r\\n    I lay upon thy lips.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear.\\r\\n    Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,\\r\\n    Lest I be taken. Not th\\' imperious show\\r\\n    Of the full-fortun\\'d Caesar ever shall\\r\\n    Be brooch\\'d with me.

My lord!\\r\\n    O, wither\\'d is the garland of the war,\\r\\n    The soldier\\'s pole is fall\\'n! Young boys and girls\\r\\n    Are level now with men.

Peace, peace, Iras!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. No more but e\\'en a woman, and commanded\\r\\n    By such poor passion as the maid that milks\\r\\n    And does the meanest chares.

Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;\\r\\n    Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks\\r\\n    The pauses that he makes.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Caesar, I shall.                               Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n             Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar\\'st\\r\\n    Appear thus to us?\\r\\n  DERCETAS. I am call\\'d Dercetas;\\r\\n    Mark Antony I serv\\'d, who best was worthy\\r\\n    Best to be serv\\'d. Whilst he stood up and spoke,\\r\\n    He was my master, and I wore my life\\r\\n    To spend upon his haters. If thou please\\r\\n    To take me to thee, as I was to him\\r\\n    I\\'ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,\\r\\n    I yield thee up my life.\\r\\n  CAESAR. What is\\'t thou say\\'st?\\r\\n  DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.\\r\\n  CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make\\r\\n    A greater crack. The round world\\r\\n    Should have shook lions into civil streets,\\r\\n    And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony\\r\\n    Is not a single doom; in the name lay\\r\\n    A moiety of the world.\\r\\n  DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,\\r\\n    Not by a public minister of justice,\\r\\n    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand\\r\\n    Which writ his honour in the acts it did\\r\\n    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,\\r\\n    Splitted the heart. This is his sword;\\r\\n    I robb\\'d his wound of it; behold it stain\\'d\\r\\n    With his most noble blood.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Look you sad, friends?\\r\\n    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings\\r\\n    To wash the eyes of kings.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. And strange it is\\r\\n    That nature must compel us to lament\\r\\n    Our most persisted deeds.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. His taints and honours\\r\\n    Wag\\'d equal with him.\\r\\n  AGRIPPA. A rarer spirit never\\r\\n    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us\\r\\n    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch\\'d.\\r\\n  MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror\\'s set before him,\\r\\n    He needs must see himself.\\r\\n  CAESAR. O Antony,\\r\\n    I have follow\\'d thee to this! But we do lance\\r\\n    Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce\\r\\n    Have shown to thee such a declining day\\r\\n    Or look on thine; we could not stall together\\r\\n    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,\\r\\n    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,\\r\\n    That thou, my brother, my competitor\\r\\n    In top of all design, my mate in empire,\\r\\n    Friend and companion in the front of war,\\r\\n    The arm of mine own body, and the heart\\r\\n    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,\\r\\n    Unreconciliable, should divide\\r\\n    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-\\r\\n\\r\\n                    Enter an EGYPTIAN\\r\\n\\r\\n    But I will tell you at some meeter season.\\r\\n    The business of this man looks out of him;\\r\\n    We\\'ll hear him what he says. Whence are you?\\r\\n  EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,\\r\\n    Confin\\'d in all she has, her monument,\\r\\n    Of thy intents desires instruction,\\r\\n    That she preparedly may frame herself\\r\\n    To th\\' way she\\'s forc\\'d to.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Bid her have good heart.\\r\\n    She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,\\r\\n    How honourable and how kindly we\\r\\n    Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn\\r\\n    To be ungentle.\\r\\n  EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit\\r\\n  CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say\\r\\n    We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts\\r\\n    The quality of her passion shall require,\\r\\n    Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke\\r\\n    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome\\r\\n    Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,\\r\\n    And with your speediest bring us what she says,\\r\\n    And how you find her.\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I shall.                              Exit\\r\\n  CAESAR. Gallus, go you along.                      Exit GALLUS\\r\\n    Where\\'s Dolabella, to second Proculeius?\\r\\n  ALL. Dolabella!\\r\\n  CAESAR.

My desolation does begin to make\\r\\n    A better life. \\'Tis paltry to be Caesar:\\r\\n    Not being Fortune, he\\'s but Fortune\\'s knave,\\r\\n    A minister of her will; and it is great\\r\\n    To do that thing that ends all other deeds,\\r\\n    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,\\r\\n    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,\\r\\n    The beggar\\'s nurse and Caesar\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n       Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,\\r\\n                          and soldiers\\r\\n\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS.

My name is Proculeius.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Antony\\r\\n    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but\\r\\n    I do not greatly care to be deceiv\\'d,\\r\\n    That have no use for trusting. If your master\\r\\n    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him\\r\\n    That majesty, to keep decorum, must\\r\\n    No less beg than a kingdom. If he please\\r\\n    To give me conquer\\'d Egypt for my son,\\r\\n    He gives me so much of mine own as I\\r\\n    Will kneel to him with thanks.\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS. Be of good cheer;\\r\\n    Y\\'are fall\\'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.\\r\\n    Make your full reference freely to my lord,\\r\\n    Who is so full of grace that it flows over\\r\\n    On all that need. Let me report to him\\r\\n    Your sweet dependency, and you shall find\\r\\n    A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness\\r\\n    Where he for grace is kneel\\'d to.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him\\r\\n    I am his fortune\\'s vassal and I send him\\r\\n    The greatness he has got. I hourly learn\\r\\n    A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly\\r\\n    Look him i\\' th\\' face.\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS. This I\\'ll report, dear lady.\\r\\n    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied\\r\\n    Of him that caus\\'d it.\\r\\n  GALLUS. You see how easily she may be surpris\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the\\r\\n       monument by a ladder placed against a window,\\r\\n       and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard\\r\\n                unbar and open the gates\\r\\n\\r\\n    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit\\r\\n  IRAS. Royal Queen!\\r\\n  CHARMIAN.

What, of death too,\\r\\n    That rids our dogs of languish?\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,\\r\\n    Do not abuse my master\\'s bounty by\\r\\n    Th\\' undoing of yourself.

Come, come, and take a queen\\r\\n    Worth many babes and beggars!\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I\\'ll not drink, sir;\\r\\n    If idle talk will once be necessary,\\r\\n    I\\'ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I\\'ll ruin,\\r\\n    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\\r\\n    Will not wait pinion\\'d at your master\\'s court,\\r\\n    Nor once be chastis\\'d with the sober eye\\r\\n    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,\\r\\n    And show me to the shouting varletry\\r\\n    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\\r\\n    Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus\\' mud\\r\\n    Lay me stark-nak\\'d, and let the water-flies\\r\\n    Blow me into abhorring! Rather make\\r\\n    My country\\'s high pyramides my gibbet,\\r\\n    And hang me up in chains!\\r\\n  PROCULEIUS.

I understand not, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-\\r\\n    O, such another sleep, that I might see\\r\\n    But such another man!\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. If it might please ye-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav\\'ns, and therein stuck\\r\\n    A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted\\r\\n    The little O, the earth.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Most sovereign creature-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear\\'d arm\\r\\n    Crested the world. His voice was propertied\\r\\n    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\\r\\n    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\\r\\n    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\\r\\n    There was no winter in\\'t; an autumn \\'twas\\r\\n    That grew the more by reaping. His delights\\r\\n    Were dolphin-like: they show\\'d his back above\\r\\n    The element they liv\\'d in.

Think you there was or might be such a man\\r\\n    As this I dreamt of?\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.\\r\\n    But if there be nor ever were one such,\\r\\n    It\\'s past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff\\r\\n    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t\\' imagine\\r\\n    An Antony were nature\\'s piece \\'gainst fancy,\\r\\n    Condemning shadows quite.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.\\r\\n    Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it\\r\\n    As answering to the weight. Would I might never\\r\\n    O\\'ertake pursu\\'d success, but I do feel,\\r\\n    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites\\r\\n    My very heart at root.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.\\r\\n    Know you what Caesar means to do with me?\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He\\'ll lead me, then, in triumph?\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know\\'t.                [Flourish]\\r\\n                              [Within: \\'Make way there-Caesar!\\']\\r\\n\\r\\n       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,\\r\\n                     and others of his train\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]\\r\\n  CAESAR. Arise, you shall not kneel.\\r\\n    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods\\r\\n    Will have it thus; my master and my lord\\r\\n    I must obey.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts.\\r\\n    The record of what injuries you did us,\\r\\n    Though written in our flesh, we shall remember\\r\\n    As things but done by chance.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o\\' th\\' world,\\r\\n    I cannot project mine own cause so well\\r\\n    To make it clear, but do confess I have\\r\\n    Been laden with like frailties which before\\r\\n    Have often sham\\'d our sex.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know\\r\\n    We will extenuate rather than enforce.\\r\\n    If you apply yourself to our intents-\\r\\n    Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find\\r\\n    A benefit in this change; but if you seek\\r\\n    To lay on me a cruelty by taking\\r\\n    Antony\\'s course, you shall bereave yourself\\r\\n    Of my good purposes, and put your children\\r\\n    To that destruction which I\\'ll guard them from,\\r\\n    If thereon you rely. I\\'ll take my leave.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. \\'Tis yours, and we,\\r\\n    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\\r\\n    Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\\r\\n  CAESAR. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,\\r\\n    I am possess\\'d of. \\'Tis exactly valued,\\r\\n    Not petty things admitted. Where\\'s Seleucus?\\r\\n  SELEUCUS. Here, madam.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,\\r\\n    Upon his peril, that I have reserv\\'d\\r\\n    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\\r\\n  SELEUCUS. Madam,\\r\\n    I had rather seal my lips than to my peril\\r\\n    Speak that which is not.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?\\r\\n  SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made known.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve\\r\\n    Your wisdom in the deed.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,\\r\\n    How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;\\r\\n    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\\r\\n    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does\\r\\n    Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust\\r\\n    Than love that\\'s hir\\'d! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt\\r\\n    Go back, I warrant thee; but I\\'ll catch thine eyes\\r\\n    Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!\\r\\n    O rarely base!\\r\\n  CAESAR. Good Queen, let us entreat you.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\\r\\n    That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,\\r\\n    Doing the honour of thy lordliness\\r\\n    To one so meek, that mine own servant should\\r\\n    Parcel the sum of my disgraces by\\r\\n    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\\r\\n    That I some lady trifles have reserv\\'d,\\r\\n    Immoment toys, things of such dignity\\r\\n    As we greet modern friends withal; and say\\r\\n    Some nobler token I have kept apart\\r\\n    For Livia and Octavia, to induce\\r\\n    Their mediation- must I be unfolded\\r\\n    With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me\\r\\n    Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;\\r\\n    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits\\r\\n    Through th\\' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,\\r\\n    Thou wouldst have mercy on me.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought\\r\\n    For things that others do; and when we fall\\r\\n    We answer others\\' merits in our name,\\r\\n    Are therefore to be pitied.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Cleopatra,\\r\\n    Not what you have reserv\\'d, nor what acknowledg\\'d,\\r\\n    Put we i\\' th\\' roll of conquest. Still be\\'t yours,\\r\\n    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe\\r\\n    Caesar\\'s no merchant, to make prize with you\\r\\n    Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer\\'d;\\r\\n    Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;\\r\\n    For we intend so to dispose you as\\r\\n    Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.\\r\\n    Our care and pity is so much upon you\\r\\n    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord!\\r\\n  CAESAR. Not so. Adieu.\\r\\n                           Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\\r\\n    Be noble to myself.

Dolabella!\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,\\r\\n    Which my love makes religion to obey,\\r\\n    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria\\r\\n    Intends his journey, and within three days\\r\\n    You with your children will he send before.\\r\\n    Make your best use of this; I have perform\\'d\\r\\n    Your pleasure and my promise.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Dolabella,\\r\\n    I shall remain your debtor.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. I your servant.\\r\\n    Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Farewell, and thanks.                Exit DOLABELLA\\r\\n    Now, Iras, what think\\'st thou?\\r\\n    Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown\\r\\n    In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,\\r\\n    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall\\r\\n    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,\\r\\n    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,\\r\\n    And forc\\'d to drink their vapour.\\r\\n  IRAS. The gods forbid!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Nay, \\'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors\\r\\n    Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers\\r\\n    Ballad us out o\\' tune; the quick comedians\\r\\n    Extemporally will stage us, and present\\r\\n    Our Alexandrian revels; Antony\\r\\n    Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\\r\\n    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\\r\\n    I\\' th\\' posture of a whore.\\r\\n  IRAS. O the good gods!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Nay, that\\'s certain.\\r\\n  IRAS. I\\'ll never see\\'t, for I am sure mine nails\\r\\n    Are stronger than mine eyes.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Why, that\\'s the way\\r\\n    To fool their preparation and to conquer\\r\\n    Their most absurd intents.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter CHARMIAN\\r\\n\\r\\n    Now, Charmian!\\r\\n    Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch\\r\\n    My best attires. I am again for Cydnus,\\r\\n    To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.\\r\\n    Now, noble Charmian, we\\'ll dispatch indeed;\\r\\n    And when thou hast done this chare, I\\'ll give thee leave\\r\\n    To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\\r\\n                                       Exit IRAS. A noise within\\r\\n    Wherefore\\'s this noise?\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter a GUARDSMAN\\r\\n\\r\\n  GUARDSMAN. Here is a rural fellow\\r\\n    That will not be denied your Highness\\' presence.\\r\\n    He brings you figs.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Let him come in.                     Exit GUARDSMAN\\r\\n    What poor an instrument\\r\\n    May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.\\r\\n    My resolution\\'s plac\\'d, and I have nothing\\r\\n    Of woman in me. Now from head to foot\\r\\n    I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon\\r\\n    No planet is of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n          Re-enter GUARDSMAN and CLOWN, with a basket\\r\\n\\r\\n  GUARDSMAN. This is the man.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Avoid, and leave him.                Exit GUARDSMAN\\r\\n    Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there\\r\\n    That kills and pains not?\\r\\n  CLOWN. Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should\\r\\n    desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that\\r\\n    do die of it do seldom or never recover.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Remember\\'st thou any that have died on\\'t?\\r\\n  CLOWN. Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no\\r\\n    longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given\\r\\n    to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how\\r\\n    she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes\\r\\n    a very good report o\\' th\\' worm. But he that will believe all that\\r\\n    they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is\\r\\n    most falliable, the worm\\'s an odd worm.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Get thee hence; farewell.\\r\\n  CLOWN. I wish you all joy of the worm.\\r\\n                                          [Sets down the basket]\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Farewell.\\r\\n  CLOWN. You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his\\r\\n    kind.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; farewell.\\r\\n  CLOWN. Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping\\r\\n    of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.\\r\\n  CLOWN. Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth\\r\\n    the feeding.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Will it eat me?\\r\\n  CLOWN. You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil\\r\\n    himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for\\r\\n    the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same\\r\\n    whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in\\r\\n    every ten that they make the devils mar five.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Well, get thee gone; farewell.\\r\\n  CLOWN. Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o\\' th\\' worm.         Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n             Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have\\r\\n    Immortal longings in me. Now no more\\r\\n    The juice of Egypt\\'s grape shall moist this lip.\\r\\n    Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\\r\\n    Antony call. I see him rouse himself\\r\\n    To praise my noble act. I hear him mock\\r\\n    The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\\r\\n    To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.\\r\\n    Now to that name my courage prove my title!\\r\\n    I am fire and air; my other elements\\r\\n    I give to baser life. So, have you done?\\r\\n    Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\\r\\n    Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.\\r\\n                              [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]\\r\\n    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\\r\\n    If thus thou and nature can so gently part,\\r\\n    The stroke of death is as a lover\\'s pinch,\\r\\n    Which hurts and is desir\\'d. Dost thou lie still?\\r\\n    If thou vanishest, thou tell\\'st the world\\r\\n    It is not worth leave-taking.\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say\\r\\n    The gods themselves do weep.\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. This proves me base.\\r\\n    If she first meet the curled Antony,\\r\\n    He\\'ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\\r\\n    Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,\\r\\n                    [To an asp, which she applies to her breast]\\r\\n    With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\\r\\n    Of life at once untie.

Peace, peace!\\r\\n    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast\\r\\n    That sucks the nurse asleep?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break!\\r\\n  CLEOPATRA. As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-\\r\\n    O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:\\r\\n                               [Applying another asp to her arm]\\r\\n    What should I stay-                                   [Dies]\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.\\r\\n    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies\\r\\n    A lass unparallel\\'d. Downy windows, close;\\r\\n    And golden Phoebus never be beheld\\r\\n    Of eyes again so royal!

Speak softly, wake her not.\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. Caesar hath sent-\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]\\r\\n    O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. Approach, ho! All\\'s not well: Caesar\\'s beguil\\'d.\\r\\n  SECOND GUARD. There\\'s Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?\\r\\n  CHARMIAN. It is well done, and fitting for a princes\\r\\n    Descended of so many royal kings.\\r\\n    Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Re-enter DOLABELLA\\r\\n\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. How goes it here?\\r\\n  SECOND GUARD. All dead.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Caesar, thy thoughts\\r\\n    Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming\\r\\n    To see perform\\'d the dreaded act which thou\\r\\n    So sought\\'st to hinder.\\r\\n                      [Within: \\'A way there, a way for Caesar!\\']\\r\\n\\r\\n              Re-enter CAESAR and all his train\\r\\n\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:\\r\\n    That you did fear is done.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Bravest at the last,\\r\\n    She levell\\'d at our purposes, and being royal,\\r\\n    Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?\\r\\n    I do not see them bleed.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. A simple countryman that brought her figs.\\r\\n    This was his basket.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Poison\\'d then.\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. O Caesar,\\r\\n    This Charmian liv\\'d but now; she stood and spake.\\r\\n    I found her trimming up the diadem\\r\\n    On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,\\r\\n    And on the sudden dropp\\'d.\\r\\n  CAESAR. O noble weakness!\\r\\n    If they had swallow\\'d poison \\'twould appear\\r\\n    By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,\\r\\n    As she would catch another Antony\\r\\n    In her strong toil of grace.\\r\\n  DOLABELLA. Here on her breast\\r\\n    There is a vent of blood, and something blown;\\r\\n    The like is on her arm.\\r\\n  FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic\\'s trail; and these fig-leaves\\r\\n    Have slime upon them, such as th\\' aspic leaves\\r\\n    Upon the caves of Nile.\\r\\n  CAESAR. Most probable\\r\\n    That so she died; for her physician tells me\\r\\n    She hath pursu\\'d conclusions infinite\\r\\n    Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,\\r\\n    And bear her women from the monument.\\r\\n    She shall be buried by her Antony;\\r\\n    No grave upon the earth shall clip in it\\r\\n    A pair so famous. High events as these\\r\\n    Strike those that make them; and their story is\\r\\n    No less in pity than his glory which\\r\\n    Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall\\r\\n    In solemn show attend this funeral,\\r\\n    And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\\r\\n    High order in this great solemnity.

Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in\\r\\n black.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must\\r\\nattend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in\\r\\nsubjection.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He\\r\\nthat so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his\\r\\nvirtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,\\r\\nrather than lack it where there is such abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath\\r\\npersecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process\\r\\nbut only the losing of hope by time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThis young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage\\r\\n’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d\\r\\nso far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for\\r\\nlack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it\\r\\nwould be the death of the king’s disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be\\r\\nso: Gerard de Narbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him\\r\\nadmiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still,\\r\\nif knowledge could be set up against mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nA fistula, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI heard not of it before.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of\\r\\nGerard de Narbon?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those\\r\\nhopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she\\r\\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind\\r\\ncarries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are\\r\\nvirtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their\\r\\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\n’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance\\r\\nof her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows\\r\\ntakes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no\\r\\nmore, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the\\r\\nenemy to the living.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHow understand we that?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\r\\nIn manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue\\r\\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\r\\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\\r\\nDo wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy\\r\\nRather in power than use; and keep thy friend\\r\\nUnder thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,\\r\\nBut never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,\\r\\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\\r\\nFall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,\\r\\n’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,\\r\\nAdvise him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe cannot want the best\\r\\nThat shall attend his love.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Countess._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nThe best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you!\\r\\n[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make\\r\\nmuch of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\\r\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\r\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\r\\nI have forgot him; my imagination\\r\\nCarries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.\\r\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\r\\nIf Bertram be away. ’Twere all one\\r\\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\\r\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\\r\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\r\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\r\\nTh’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\r\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\r\\nMust die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,\\r\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\r\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\r\\nIn our heart’s table,—heart too capable\\r\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\\r\\nBut now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\r\\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\\r\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\r\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\r\\nYet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him\\r\\nThat they take place when virtue’s steely bones\\r\\nLooks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\r\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSave you, fair queen!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAnd you, monarch!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAnd no.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.\\r\\nMan is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nKeep him out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet\\r\\nis weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow\\r\\nyou up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no\\r\\nmilitary policy how virgins might blow up men?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in\\r\\nblowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your\\r\\ncity. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve\\r\\nvirginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never\\r\\nvirgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\r\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times\\r\\nfound; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.\\r\\nAway with it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThere’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To\\r\\nspeak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most\\r\\ninfallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity\\r\\nmurders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\\r\\nlimit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\\r\\nmites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\\r\\ndies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\\r\\nproud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\r\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within\\r\\nthe year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the\\r\\nprincipal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a\\r\\ncommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less\\r\\nworth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\r\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly\\r\\nsuited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which\\r\\nwear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in\\r\\nyour cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our\\r\\nFrench wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a\\r\\nwither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear.\\r\\nWill you anything with it?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nNot my virginity yet.\\r\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\r\\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\\r\\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\\r\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\r\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\\r\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\r\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\r\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\r\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\\r\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—\\r\\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\\r\\nThe court’s a learning-place; and he is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat one, i’ faith?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat I wish well. ’Tis pity—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat’s pity?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat wishing well had not a body in’t\\r\\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\\r\\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\\r\\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\\r\\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\\r\\nReturns us thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Page.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAGE.\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at\\r\\ncourt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nUnder Mars, I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI especially think, under Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy under Mars?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under\\r\\nMars.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhen he was predominant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy think you so?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat’s for advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition\\r\\nthat your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and\\r\\nI like the wear well.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return\\r\\nperfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize\\r\\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand\\r\\nwhat advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine\\r\\nunthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When\\r\\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy\\r\\nfriends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So,\\r\\nfarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\\r\\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\\r\\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\\r\\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\\r\\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\\r\\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\\r\\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\\r\\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\\r\\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\\r\\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\\r\\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\\r\\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\\r\\nThe king’s disease,—my project may deceive me,\\r\\nBut my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and\\r\\n others attending.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears;\\r\\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\\r\\nA braving war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nSo ’tis reported, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it,\\r\\nA certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,\\r\\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\\r\\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\\r\\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\\r\\nTo have us make denial.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHis love and wisdom,\\r\\nApprov’d so to your majesty, may plead\\r\\nFor amplest credence.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nHe hath arm’d our answer,\\r\\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\\r\\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\\r\\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\\r\\nTo stand on either part.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nIt well may serve\\r\\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\\r\\nFor breathing and exploit.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat’s he comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\\r\\nYoung Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nYouth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;\\r\\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\\r\\nHath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts\\r\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\r\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\r\\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\\r\\nInto the service of the time, and was\\r\\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\\r\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\\r\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\r\\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\\r\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\r\\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\\r\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\r\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\\r\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\r\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\r\\nHis equal had awak’d them, and his honour,\\r\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\r\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\r\\nHis tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him\\r\\nHe us’d as creatures of another place,\\r\\nAnd bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,\\r\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\r\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\r\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\r\\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\\r\\nBut goers backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\r\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\r\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\r\\nAs in your royal speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWould I were with him! He would always say,—\\r\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\r\\nHe scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them\\r\\nTo grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,”\\r\\nThis his good melancholy oft began\\r\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\r\\nWhen it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he,\\r\\n“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\r\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\r\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\r\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\r\\nExpire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.\\r\\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\\r\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\r\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\\r\\nTo give some labourers room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nYou’re lov’d, sir;\\r\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,\\r\\nSince the physician at your father’s died?\\r\\nHe was much fam’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nSome six months since, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;—\\r\\nLend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out\\r\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\r\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\\r\\nMy son’s no dearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nThank your majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt. Flourish._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found\\r\\nin the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty,\\r\\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\\r\\npublish them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have\\r\\nheard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for\\r\\nI know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to\\r\\nmake such knaveries yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\n’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWell, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nNo, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are\\r\\ndamned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world,\\r\\nIsbel the woman and I will do as we may.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIn what case?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIn Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I\\r\\nshall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for\\r\\nthey say barnes are blessings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he\\r\\nmust needs go that the devil drives.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIs this all your worship’s reason?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nMay the world know them?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood\\r\\nare; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s\\r\\nsake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nY’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that\\r\\nfor me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and\\r\\ngives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He\\r\\nthat comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that\\r\\ncherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\\r\\nflesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my\\r\\nfriend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no\\r\\nfear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the\\r\\npapist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads\\r\\nare both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\\r\\n   _For I the ballad will repeat,\\r\\n   Which men full true shall find;\\r\\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\\r\\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind._\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nGet you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n_   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\\r\\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\\r\\n   Fond done, done fond,\\r\\n      Was this King Priam’s joy?\\r\\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\n      And gave this sentence then:\\r\\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\\r\\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\\r\\n     There’s yet one good in ten._\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would\\r\\nGod would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the\\r\\ntithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might\\r\\nhave a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake,\\r\\n’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he\\r\\npluck one.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nThat man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though\\r\\nhonesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the\\r\\nsurplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,\\r\\nforsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWell, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without\\r\\nother advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds;\\r\\nthere is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than\\r\\nshe’ll demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone\\r\\nshe was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;\\r\\nshe thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense.\\r\\nHer matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess,\\r\\nthat had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god,\\r\\nthat would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana\\r\\nno queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d,\\r\\nwithout rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she\\r\\ndeliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin\\r\\nexclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\\r\\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to\\r\\nknow it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many\\r\\nlikelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the\\r\\nbalance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt.

I will\\r\\nspeak with you further anon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Steward._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\\r\\nIf ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn\\r\\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\\r\\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\\r\\nIt is the show and seal of nature’s truth,\\r\\nWhere love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth.\\r\\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\\r\\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\\r\\nHer eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou know, Helen,\\r\\nI am a mother to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMine honourable mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nNay, a mother.\\r\\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\\r\\nMethought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother,\\r\\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\\r\\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\\r\\nThat were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen\\r\\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\\r\\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\\r\\nYou ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,\\r\\nYet I express to you a mother’s care.\\r\\nGod’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\\r\\nTo say I am thy mother?

What! pale again?\\r\\nMy fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see\\r\\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\\r\\nYour salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross\\r\\nYou love my son; invention is asham’d,\\r\\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\\r\\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\\r\\nBut tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\\r\\nConfess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes\\r\\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\\r\\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\\r\\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\\r\\nThat truth should be suspected.

Come, come, disclose\\r\\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\\r\\nHave to the full appeach’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThen I confess,\\r\\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\\r\\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\\r\\nI love your son.\\r\\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love.\\r\\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\\r\\nThat he is lov’d of me; I follow him not\\r\\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\\r\\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\\r\\nYet never know how that desert should be.\\r\\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\\r\\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\\r\\nI still pour in the waters of my love\\r\\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\\r\\nReligious in mine error, I adore\\r\\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\\r\\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\\r\\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\\r\\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\\r\\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\\r\\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\\r\\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\\r\\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\\r\\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\\r\\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\\r\\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\\r\\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHad you not lately an intent,—speak truly,—\\r\\nTo go to Paris?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMadam, I had.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWherefore? tell true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\\r\\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\\r\\nOf rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading\\r\\nAnd manifest experience had collected\\r\\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will’d me\\r\\nIn heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,\\r\\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\\r\\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\\r\\nThere is a remedy, approv’d, set down,\\r\\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\\r\\nThe king is render’d lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThis was your motive\\r\\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\\r\\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\\r\\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\\r\\nHaply been absent then.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nBut think you, Helen,\\r\\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\\r\\nHe would receive it?

Farewell, young lords.\\r\\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\\r\\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,—\\r\\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\\r\\nOf the last monarchy—see that you come\\r\\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\\r\\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\\r\\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\\r\\nThey say our French lack language to deny\\r\\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\\r\\nBefore you serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTH.\\r\\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nFarewell.—Come hither to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_The King retires to a couch._]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n’Tis not his fault; the spark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nO, ’tis brave wars!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMost admirable!

Good sparks and lustrous, a\\r\\nword, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one\\r\\nCaptain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his\\r\\nsinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it.

After them, and take a more dilated farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd I will do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWorthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lafew.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nPardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI’ll fee thee to stand up.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThen here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon.\\r\\nI would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,\\r\\nAnd that at my bidding you could so stand up.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\\r\\nAnd ask’d thee mercy for’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGood faith, across;\\r\\nBut, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d\\r\\nOf your infirmity?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nO, will you eat\\r\\nNo grapes, my royal fox?

I have seen a medicine\\r\\nThat’s able to breathe life into a stone,\\r\\nQuicken a rock, and make you dance canary\\r\\nWith sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch\\r\\nIs powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,\\r\\nTo give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand\\r\\nAnd write to her a love-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat ‘her’ is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhy, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d,\\r\\nIf you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,\\r\\nIf seriously I may convey my thoughts\\r\\nIn this my light deliverance, I have spoke\\r\\nWith one that in her sex, her years, profession,\\r\\nWisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more\\r\\nThan I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,\\r\\nFor that is her demand, and know her business?\\r\\nThat done, laugh well at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNow, good Lafew,\\r\\nBring in the admiration; that we with thee\\r\\nMay spend our wonder too, or take off thine\\r\\nBy wond’ring how thou took’st it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, I’ll fit you,\\r\\nAnd not be all day neither.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThus he his special nothing ever prologues.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lafew with Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, come your ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThis haste hath wings indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, come your ways.\\r\\nThis is his majesty, say your mind to him.\\r\\nA traitor you do look like, but such traitors\\r\\nHis majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle,\\r\\nThat dare leave two together.

Within what space\\r\\nHop’st thou my cure?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThe greatest grace lending grace.\\r\\nEre twice the horses of the sun shall bring\\r\\nTheir fiery torcher his diurnal ring,\\r\\nEre twice in murk and occidental damp\\r\\nMoist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp;\\r\\nOr four and twenty times the pilot’s glass\\r\\nHath told the thievish minutes how they pass;\\r\\nWhat is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,\\r\\nHealth shall live free, and sickness freely die.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nUpon thy certainty and confidence\\r\\nWhat dar’st thou venture?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nTax of impudence,\\r\\nA strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame,\\r\\nTraduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name\\r\\nSear’d otherwise; ne worse of worst extended\\r\\nWith vildest torture, let my life be ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMethinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak\\r\\nHis powerful sound within an organ weak;\\r\\nAnd what impossibility would slay\\r\\nIn common sense, sense saves another way.\\r\\nThy life is dear, for all that life can rate\\r\\nWorth name of life in thee hath estimate:\\r\\nYouth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all\\r\\nThat happiness and prime can happy call.\\r\\nThou this to hazard needs must intimate\\r\\nSkill infinite, or monstrous desperate.\\r\\nSweet practiser, thy physic I will try,\\r\\nThat ministers thine own death if I die.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIf I break time, or flinch in property\\r\\nOf what I spoke, unpitied let me die,\\r\\nAnd well deserv’d.

But to the court!\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it\\r\\noff at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand,\\r\\nand say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such\\r\\na fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have\\r\\nan answer will serve all men.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nMarry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIt is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock,\\r\\nthe quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWill your answer serve fit to all questions?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French\\r\\ncrown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a\\r\\npancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his\\r\\nhole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling\\r\\nknave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to\\r\\nhis skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIt must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth\\r\\nof it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a\\r\\ncourtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nTo be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to\\r\\nbe the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Spare not me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nDo you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed\\r\\nyour ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer\\r\\nvery well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may\\r\\nserve long, but not serve ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily\\r\\nwith a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nAn end, sir! To your business. Give Helen this,\\r\\nAnd urge her to a present answer back.\\r\\nCommend me to my kinsmen and my son.\\r\\nThis is not much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nNot much commendation to them?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nNot much employment for you. You understand me?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nMost fruitfully. I am there before my legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHaste you again.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt severally._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Paris. The King’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThey say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to\\r\\nmake modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it\\r\\nthat we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming\\r\\nknowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our\\r\\nlatter times.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd so ’tis.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nTo be relinquish’d of the artists,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSo I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nOf all the learned and authentic fellows,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nRight; so I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThat gave him out incurable,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, there ’tis; so say I too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNot to be helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nRight; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nUncertain life and sure death.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nJust; you say well. So would I have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt is indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what\\r\\ndo you call there?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nA showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat’s it; I would have said the very same.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhy, your dolphin is not lustier; fore me, I speak in respect—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nNay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious\\r\\nof it; and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge\\r\\nit to be the—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nVery hand of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, so I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nIn a most weak—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAnd debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should\\r\\nindeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the\\r\\nking, as to be—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGenerally thankful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter King, Helena and Attendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nLustique, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I\\r\\nhave a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n_Mor du vinager!_ is not this Helen?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nFore God, I think so.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nGo, call before me all the lords in court.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side,\\r\\nAnd with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense\\r\\nThou has repeal’d, a second time receive\\r\\nThe confirmation of my promis’d gift,\\r\\nWhich but attends thy naming.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter several Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel\\r\\nOf noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,\\r\\nO’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice\\r\\nI have to use. Thy frank election make;\\r\\nThou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nTo each of you one fair and virtuous mistress\\r\\nFall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI’d give bay curtal and his furniture\\r\\nMy mouth no more were broken than these boys’,\\r\\nAnd writ as little beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nPeruse them well.\\r\\nNot one of those but had a noble father.\\r\\n\\r\\n She addresses her to a Lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nGentlemen,\\r\\nHeaven hath through me restor’d the king to health.\\r\\n\\r\\nALL.\\r\\nWe understand it, and thank heaven for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest\\r\\nThat I protest I simply am a maid.\\r\\nPlease it, your majesty, I have done already.\\r\\nThe blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:\\r\\n“We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,\\r\\nLet the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,\\r\\nWe’ll ne’er come there again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMake choice; and, see,\\r\\nWho shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nNow, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,\\r\\nAnd to imperial Love, that god most high,\\r\\nDo my sighs stream. [_To first Lord._] Sir, will you hear my suit?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nAnd grant it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\n[_To second Lord._] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\\r\\nBefore I speak, too threat’ningly replies.\\r\\nLove make your fortunes twenty times above\\r\\nHer that so wishes, and her humble love!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nNo better, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMy wish receive,\\r\\nWhich great Love grant; and so I take my leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nDo all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I’d have them whipp’d;\\r\\nor I would send them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\n[_To third Lord._] Be not afraid that I your hand should take;\\r\\nI’ll never do you wrong for your own sake.\\r\\nBlessing upon your vows, and in your bed\\r\\nFind fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThese boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are\\r\\nbastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\n[_To fourth Lord._] You are too young, too happy, and too good,\\r\\nTo make yourself a son out of my blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTH LORD.\\r\\nFair one, I think not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThere’s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou\\r\\nbeest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\n[_To Bertram._] I dare not say I take you, but I give\\r\\nMe and my service, ever whilst I live,\\r\\nInto your guiding power. This is the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\\r\\nIn such a business give me leave to use\\r\\nThe help of mine own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nKnow’st thou not, Bertram,\\r\\nWhat she has done for me?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nYes, my good lord,\\r\\nBut never hope to know why I should marry her.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nBut follows it, my lord, to bring me down\\r\\nMust answer for your raising? I know her well;\\r\\nShe had her breeding at my father’s charge:\\r\\nA poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain\\r\\nRather corrupt me ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\n’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which\\r\\nI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\\r\\nOf colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,\\r\\nWould quite confound distinction, yet stands off\\r\\nIn differences so mighty. If she be\\r\\nAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st,\\r\\nA poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st—\\r\\nOf virtue for the name. But do not so.\\r\\nFrom lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\\r\\nThe place is dignified by the doer’s deed.\\r\\nWhere great additions swell’s, and virtue none,\\r\\nIt is a dropsied honour. Good alone\\r\\nIs good without a name; vileness is so:\\r\\nThe property by what it is should go,\\r\\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\\r\\nIn these to nature she’s immediate heir;\\r\\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn\\r\\nWhich challenges itself as honour’s born,\\r\\nAnd is not like the sire. Honours thrive\\r\\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\\r\\nThan our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave,\\r\\nDebauch’d on every tomb, on every grave\\r\\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\\r\\nWhere dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb\\r\\nOf honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?\\r\\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\\r\\nI can create the rest. Virtue and she\\r\\nIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat you are well restor’d, my lord, I am glad.\\r\\nLet the rest go.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMy honour’s at the stake, which to defeat,\\r\\nI must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\\r\\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,\\r\\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\\r\\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream\\r\\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\\r\\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know\\r\\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\\r\\nWe please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;\\r\\nObey our will, which travails in thy good;\\r\\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\\r\\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\\r\\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\\r\\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\\r\\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\\r\\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\\r\\nLoosing upon thee in the name of justice,\\r\\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\\r\\nMy fancy to your eyes. When I consider\\r\\nWhat great creation, and what dole of honour\\r\\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\\r\\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\\r\\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\\r\\nIs as ’twere born so.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nTake her by the hand,\\r\\nAnd tell her she is thine; to whom I promise\\r\\nA counterpoise; if not to thy estate,\\r\\nA balance more replete.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI take her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\\r\\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\\r\\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\\r\\nAnd be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast\\r\\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\\r\\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her,\\r\\nThy love’s to me religious; else, does err.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nDo you hear, monsieur? A word with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nYour pleasure, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYour lord and master did well to make his recantation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nRecantation! My lord! My master!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nAy. Is it not a language I speak?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nA most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.\\r\\nMy master!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nAre you companion to the Count Rossillon?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nTo any count; to all counts; to what is man.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nTo what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nYou are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring\\r\\nthee.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat I dare too well do, I dare not do.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou\\r\\ndidst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs\\r\\nand the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing\\r\\nthee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose\\r\\nthee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and\\r\\nthat thou art scarce worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial;\\r\\nwhich if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of\\r\\nlattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look\\r\\nthrough thee. Give me thy hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy lord, you give me most egregious indignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nAy, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI have not, my lord, deserv’d it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWell, I shall be wiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nEv’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’\\r\\ncontrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt\\r\\nfind what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my\\r\\nacquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the\\r\\ndefault, “He is a man I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for\\r\\ndoing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me\\r\\nleave.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old,\\r\\nfilthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of\\r\\nauthority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any\\r\\nconvenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more\\r\\npity of his age than I would have of—I’ll beat him, and if I could but\\r\\nmeet him again.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lafew.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nSirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you; you have\\r\\na new mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of\\r\\nyour wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWho? God?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThe devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’\\r\\nthis fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou\\r\\nwert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if\\r\\nI were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a\\r\\ngeneral offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast\\r\\ncreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a\\r\\npomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more\\r\\nsaucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your\\r\\nbirth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word,\\r\\nelse I’d call you knave. I leave you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nGood, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal’d\\r\\nawhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nUndone, and forfeited to cares for ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat’s the matter, sweetheart?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAlthough before the solemn priest I have sworn,\\r\\nI will not bed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat, what, sweetheart?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nO my Parolles, they have married me!\\r\\nI’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nFrance is a dog-hole, and it no more merits\\r\\nThe tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nThere’s letters from my mother; what th’ import is\\r\\nI know not yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars!\\r\\nHe wears his honour in a box unseen\\r\\nThat hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,\\r\\nSpending his manly marrow in her arms,\\r\\nWhich should sustain the bound and high curvet\\r\\nOf Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!\\r\\nFrance is a stable; we that dwell in’t, jades,\\r\\nTherefore, to th’ war!\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIt shall be so; I’ll send her to my house,\\r\\nAcquaint my mother with my hate to her,\\r\\nAnd wherefore I am fled; write to the king\\r\\nThat which I durst not speak. His present gift\\r\\nShall furnish me to those Italian fields\\r\\nWhere noble fellows strike. War is no strife\\r\\nTo the dark house and the detested wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWill this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nGo with me to my chamber and advise me.\\r\\nI’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow\\r\\nI’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard:\\r\\nA young man married is a man that’s marr’d.\\r\\nTherefore away, and leave her bravely; go.\\r\\nThe king has done you wrong; but hush ’tis so.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. Paris. The King’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Helena and Clown.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMy mother greets me kindly: is she well?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nShe is not well, but yet she has her health; she’s very merry, but yet\\r\\nshe is not well. But thanks be given, she’s very well, and wants\\r\\nnothing i’ the world; but yet she is not well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIf she be very well, what does she ail that she’s not very well?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nTruly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat two things?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nOne, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other,\\r\\nthat she’s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nBless you, my fortunate lady!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nYou had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them\\r\\nstill. O, my knave how does my old lady?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nSo that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you\\r\\nsay.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, I say nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nMarry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his\\r\\nmaster’s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and\\r\\nto have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a\\r\\nvery little of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAway! Thou art a knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nYou should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is\\r\\nbefore me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nGo to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nDid you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The\\r\\nsearch, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to\\r\\nthe world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nA good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.\\r\\nMadam, my lord will go away tonight;\\r\\nA very serious business calls on him.\\r\\nThe great prerogative and right of love,\\r\\nWhich, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;\\r\\nBut puts it off to a compell’d restraint;\\r\\nWhose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets;\\r\\nWhich they distil now in the curbed time,\\r\\nTo make the coming hour o’erflow with joy\\r\\nAnd pleasure drown the brim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat’s his will else?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat you will take your instant leave o’ the king,\\r\\nAnd make this haste as your own good proceeding,\\r\\nStrengthen’d with what apology you think\\r\\nMay make it probable need.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat more commands he?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat, having this obtain’d, you presently\\r\\nAttend his further pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIn everything I wait upon his will.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI shall report it so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI pray you.

Camp before Florence.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram and the two French Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nIf your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your\\r\\nrespect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nOn my life, my lord, a bubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nDo you think I am so far deceived in him?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nBelieve it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice,\\r\\nbut to speak of him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an\\r\\ninfinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no\\r\\none good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nIt were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which\\r\\nhe hath not, he might at some great and trusty business, in a main\\r\\ndanger fail you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI would I knew in what particular action to try him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nNone better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so\\r\\nconfidently undertake to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him; such I will\\r\\nhave whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy; we will bind and\\r\\nhoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried\\r\\ninto the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents.\\r\\nBe but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not for the\\r\\npromise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer\\r\\nto betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against\\r\\nyou, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never\\r\\ntrust my judgment in anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nO, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a\\r\\nstratagem for’t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success\\r\\nin’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if\\r\\nyou give him not John Drum’s entertainment, your inclining cannot be\\r\\nremoved. Here he comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nO, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let\\r\\nhim fetch off his drum in any hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHow now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nA pox on ’t; let it go; ’tis but a drum.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nBut a drum! Is’t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent\\r\\ncommand, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend\\r\\nour own soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nThat was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a\\r\\ndisaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had\\r\\nbeen there to command.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in\\r\\nthe loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt might have been recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIt might, but it is not now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom\\r\\nattributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or\\r\\nanother, or _hic jacet_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur, if you think your mystery\\r\\nin stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native\\r\\nquarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the\\r\\nattempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall\\r\\nboth speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,\\r\\neven to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI’ll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,\\r\\nencourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal\\r\\npreparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI know th’art valiant; and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will\\r\\nsubscribe for thee. Farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI love not many words.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNo more than a fish loves water.

He was first\\r\\nsmok’d by the old Lord Lafew; when his disguise and he is parted, tell\\r\\nme what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI must go look my twigs. He shall be caught.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nYour brother, he shall go along with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nAs’t please your lordship.

I spoke with her but once,\\r\\nAnd found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her\\r\\nBy this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind\\r\\nTokens and letters which she did re-send,\\r\\nAnd this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature;\\r\\nWill you go see her?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWith all my heart, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE VII. Florence.

The count he woos your daughter\\r\\nLays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\\r\\nResolv’d to carry her; let her in fine consent,\\r\\nAs we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.\\r\\nNow his important blood will naught deny\\r\\nThat she’ll demand; a ring the county wears,\\r\\nThat downward hath succeeded in his house\\r\\nFrom son to son, some four or five descents\\r\\nSince the first father wore it. This ring he holds\\r\\nIn most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,\\r\\nTo buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\\r\\nHowe’er repented after.\\r\\n\\r\\nWIDOW.\\r\\nNow I see\\r\\nThe bottom of your purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYou see it lawful then; it is no more\\r\\nBut that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\\r\\nDesires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\\r\\nIn fine, delivers me to fill the time,\\r\\nHerself most chastely absent. After,\\r\\nTo marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns\\r\\nTo what is pass’d already.\\r\\n\\r\\nWIDOW.\\r\\nI have yielded.\\r\\nInstruct my daughter how she shall persever,\\r\\nThat time and place with this deceit so lawful\\r\\nMay prove coherent.

Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages,\\r\\ntherefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what\\r\\nwe speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our\\r\\npurpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\\r\\ninterpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes;\\r\\nto beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies\\r\\nhe forges.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nTen o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home.\\r\\nWhat shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that\\r\\ncarries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d\\r\\ntoo often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart\\r\\nhath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the\\r\\nreports of my tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\n[_Aside._] This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was\\r\\nguilty of.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum,\\r\\nbeing not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such\\r\\npurpose?

But, fair soul,\\r\\nIn your fine frame hath love no quality?\\r\\nIf the quick fire of youth light not your mind,\\r\\nYou are no maiden but a monument;\\r\\nWhen you are dead, you should be such a one\\r\\nAs you are now; for you are cold and stern,\\r\\nAnd now you should be as your mother was\\r\\nWhen your sweet self was got.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nShe then was honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nSo should you be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nMy mother did but duty; such, my lord,\\r\\nAs you owe to your wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNo more a’ that!\\r\\nI pr’ythee do not strive against my vows;\\r\\nI was compell’d to her; but I love thee\\r\\nBy love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever\\r\\nDo thee all rights of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nAy, so you serve us\\r\\nTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,\\r\\nYou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,\\r\\nAnd mock us with our bareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHow have I sworn?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\n’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\\r\\nBut the plain single vow that is vow’d true.\\r\\nWhat is not holy, that we swear not by,\\r\\nBut take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\\r\\nIf I should swear by Jove’s great attributes\\r\\nI lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths\\r\\nWhen I did love you ill? This has no holding,\\r\\nTo swear by him whom I protest to love\\r\\nThat I will work against him. Therefore your oaths\\r\\nAre words and poor conditions; but unseal’d,—\\r\\nAt least in my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nChange it, change it.\\r\\nBe not so holy-cruel.

I will tell you\\r\\na thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nWhen you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most\\r\\nchaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her\\r\\nhonour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made\\r\\nin the unchaste composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNow, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons,\\r\\nwe still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d\\r\\nends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in\\r\\nhis proper stream, o’erflows himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful\\r\\nintents? We shall not then have his company tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThat approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company\\r\\nanatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein\\r\\nso curiously he had set this counterfeit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the\\r\\nwhip of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIn the meantime, what hear you of these wars?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWhat will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return\\r\\nagain into France?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nLet it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence\\r\\nis a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with\\r\\nmost austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the\\r\\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a\\r\\ngroan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHow is this justified?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true,\\r\\neven to the point of her death.

But to answer\\r\\nyou as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her\\r\\nmilk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a\\r\\nfriar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster\\r\\nof his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNothing of me, has he?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your\\r\\nlordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to\\r\\nhear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Soldiers with Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHe calls for the tortures.

I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAll’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nYou are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant\\r\\nmilitarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war\\r\\nin the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe\\r\\nhe can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set\\r\\ndown,—for I’ll speak truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHe’s very near the truth in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nBut I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nPoor rogues, I pray you say.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous\\r\\npoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell\\r\\ntrue.

Demand of him my condition, and what\\r\\ncredit I have with the duke.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain\\r\\nDumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the\\r\\nduke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he\\r\\nthinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt\\r\\nhim to a revolt.’ What say you to this?

I think I have his\\r\\nletter in my pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nMarry, we’ll search.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a\\r\\nfile, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHere ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI do not know if it be it or no.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nOur interpreter does it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nExcellently.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n[_Reads._] _Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold._\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a\\r\\nproper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of\\r\\none Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, put it up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nNay, I’ll read it first by your favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid;\\r\\nfor I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is\\r\\na whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nDamnable both sides rogue!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n[_Reads._]\\r\\n_When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\\r\\nAfter he scores, he never pays the score.\\r\\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\\r\\nHe ne’er pays after-debts, take it before.\\r\\nAnd say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this:\\r\\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;\\r\\nFor count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,\\r\\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\\r\\nThine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,_\\r\\n                                     PAROLLES.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the\\r\\narmipotent soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nI perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy life, sir, in any case.

Therefore, once more\\r\\nto this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the\\r\\nduke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments\\r\\nhe parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking\\r\\nthem he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such\\r\\nvolubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his\\r\\nbest virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does\\r\\nlittle harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his\\r\\nconditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of\\r\\nhis honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what\\r\\nan honest man should have, he has nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI begin to love him for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nFor this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more\\r\\nand more a cat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat say you to his expertness in war?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nFaith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie\\r\\nhim I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that\\r\\ncountry he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called\\r\\nMile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man\\r\\nwhat honour I can, but of this I am not certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHe hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nA pox on him! He’s a cat still.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHis qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold\\r\\nwill corrupt him to revolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation,\\r\\nthe inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a\\r\\nperpetual succession for it perpetually.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWhy does he ask him of me?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat’s he?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nE’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in\\r\\ngoodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a\\r\\ncoward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a\\r\\nretreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nI’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n[_Aside._] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums!

The general says you that\\r\\nhave so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such\\r\\npestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no\\r\\nhonest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nO Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nThat shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Unmuffling him._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, look about you; know you any here?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nGood morrow, noble captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nGod bless you, Captain Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nGod save you, noble captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nCaptain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew?

The same. A room in the Countess’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWe lost a jewel of her, and our esteem\\r\\nWas made much poorer by it; but your son,\\r\\nAs mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know\\r\\nHer estimation home.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\n’Tis past, my liege,\\r\\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\\r\\nNatural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth,\\r\\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,\\r\\nO’erbears it and burns on.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMy honour’d lady,\\r\\nI have forgiven and forgotten all,\\r\\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\\r\\nAnd watch’d the time to shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThis I must say,—\\r\\nBut first, I beg my pardon,—the young lord\\r\\nDid to his majesty, his mother, and his lady,\\r\\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\\r\\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\\r\\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\\r\\nOf richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;\\r\\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve\\r\\nHumbly call’d mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nPraising what is lost\\r\\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\\r\\nWe are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill\\r\\nAll repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;\\r\\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\\r\\nAnd deeper than oblivion do we bury\\r\\nTh’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach\\r\\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\\r\\nSo ’tis our will he should.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMAN.\\r\\nI shall, my liege.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Gentleman._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nAll that he is hath reference to your highness.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThen shall we have a match. I have letters sent me\\r\\nThat sets him high in fame.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe looks well on ’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI am not a day of season,\\r\\nFor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\\r\\nIn me at once. But to the brightest beams\\r\\nDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\\r\\nThe time is fair again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy high-repented blames\\r\\nDear sovereign, pardon to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nAll is whole.\\r\\nNot one word more of the consumed time.\\r\\nLet’s take the instant by the forward top;\\r\\nFor we are old, and on our quick’st decrees\\r\\nTh’inaudible and noiseless foot of time\\r\\nSteals ere we can effect them. You remember\\r\\nThe daughter of this lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAdmiringly, my liege. At first\\r\\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\\r\\nDurst make too bold herald of my tongue:\\r\\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\\r\\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\\r\\nWhich warp’d the line of every other favour,\\r\\nScorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen,\\r\\nExtended or contracted all proportions\\r\\nTo a most hideous object. Thence it came\\r\\nThat she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself,\\r\\nSince I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye\\r\\nThe dust that did offend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWell excus’d:\\r\\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\\r\\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\\r\\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\\r\\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\\r\\nCrying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults\\r\\nMake trivial price of serious things we have,\\r\\nNot knowing them until we know their grave.\\r\\nOft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\\r\\nDestroy our friends, and after weep their dust:\\r\\nOur own love waking cries to see what’s done,\\r\\nWhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.\\r\\nBe this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.\\r\\nSend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.\\r\\nThe main consents are had, and here we’ll stay\\r\\nTo see our widower’s second marriage-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!\\r\\nOr, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nCome on, my son, in whom my house’s name\\r\\nMust be digested; give a favour from you,\\r\\nTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\\r\\nThat she may quickly come.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy my old beard,\\r\\nAnd ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead\\r\\nWas a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\\r\\nThe last that e’er I took her leave at court,\\r\\nI saw upon her finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHers it was not.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\\r\\nWhile I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it.\\r\\nThis ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen\\r\\nI bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\\r\\nNecessitied to help, that by this token\\r\\nI would relieve her. Had you that craft to ’reave her\\r\\nOf what should stead her most?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy gracious sovereign,\\r\\nHowe’er it pleases you to take it so,\\r\\nThe ring was never hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSon, on my life,\\r\\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it\\r\\nAt her life’s rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nYou are deceiv’d, my lord; she never saw it.\\r\\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\\r\\nWrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name\\r\\nOf her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought\\r\\nI stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d\\r\\nTo mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully\\r\\nI could not answer in that course of honour\\r\\nAs she had made the overture, she ceas’d,\\r\\nIn heavy satisfaction, and would never\\r\\nReceive the ring again.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nPlutus himself,\\r\\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\\r\\nHath not in nature’s mystery more science\\r\\nThan I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,\\r\\nWhoever gave it you. Then if you know\\r\\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\\r\\nConfess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\\r\\nYou got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety\\r\\nThat she would never put it from her finger\\r\\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\\r\\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\\r\\nUpon her great disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nShe never saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour,\\r\\nAnd mak’st conjectural fears to come into me\\r\\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\\r\\nThat thou art so inhuman,—’twill not prove so:\\r\\nAnd yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly.\\r\\nAnd she is dead; which nothing but to close\\r\\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe\\r\\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Guards seize Bertram._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,\\r\\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\\r\\nHaving vainly fear’d too little. Away with him.\\r\\nWe’ll sift this matter further.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIf you shall prove\\r\\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\\r\\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\\r\\nWhere she yet never was.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit, guarded._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMAN.\\r\\nGracious sovereign,\\r\\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\\r\\nHere’s a petition from a Florentine,\\r\\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\\r\\nTo tender it herself. I undertook it,\\r\\nVanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech\\r\\nOf the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,\\r\\nIs here attending: her business looks in her\\r\\nWith an importing visage, and she told me\\r\\nIn a sweet verbal brief, it did concern\\r\\nYour highness with herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\n[_Reads._] _Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was\\r\\ndead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillon a\\r\\nwidower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He\\r\\nstole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country\\r\\nfor justice.

I’ll none of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThe heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,\\r\\nTo bring forth this discovery.

What woman’s that?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Widow and Diana.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,\\r\\nDerived from the ancient Capilet;\\r\\nMy suit, as I do understand, you know,\\r\\nAnd therefore know how far I may be pitied.\\r\\n\\r\\nWIDOW.\\r\\nI am her mother, sir, whose age and honour\\r\\nBoth suffer under this complaint we bring,\\r\\nAnd both shall cease, without your remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nCome hither, count; do you know these women?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy lord, I neither can nor will deny\\r\\nBut that I know them. Do they charge me further?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nWhy do you look so strange upon your wife?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nShe’s none of mine, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nIf you shall marry,\\r\\nYou give away this hand, and that is mine,\\r\\nYou give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine,\\r\\nYou give away myself, which is known mine;\\r\\nFor I by vow am so embodied yours\\r\\nThat she which marries you must marry me,\\r\\nEither both or none.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\n[_To Bertram_] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are\\r\\nno husband for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy lord, this is a fond and desperate creature\\r\\nWhom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your highness\\r\\nLay a more noble thought upon mine honour\\r\\nThan for to think that I would sink it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nSir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend\\r\\nTill your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour\\r\\nThan in my thought it lies!\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nGood my lord,\\r\\nAsk him upon his oath, if he does think\\r\\nHe had not my virginity.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat say’st thou to her?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nShe’s impudent, my lord,\\r\\nAnd was a common gamester to the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nHe does me wrong, my lord; if I were so\\r\\nHe might have bought me at a common price.\\r\\nDo not believe him. O, behold this ring,\\r\\nWhose high respect and rich validity\\r\\nDid lack a parallel; yet for all that\\r\\nHe gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,\\r\\nIf I be one.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHe blushes, and ’tis it.\\r\\nOf six preceding ancestors, that gem\\r\\nConferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue,\\r\\nHath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;\\r\\nThat ring’s a thousand proofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMethought you said\\r\\nYou saw one here in court could witness it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI did, my lord, but loath am to produce\\r\\nSo bad an instrument; his name’s Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI saw the man today, if man he be.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nFind him, and bring him hither.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWhat of him?\\r\\nHe’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,\\r\\nWith all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d:\\r\\nWhose nature sickens but to speak a truth.\\r\\nAm I or that or this for what he’ll utter,\\r\\nThat will speak anything?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nShe hath that ring of yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her\\r\\nAnd boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth.\\r\\nShe knew her distance, and did angle for me,\\r\\nMadding my eagerness with her restraint,\\r\\nAs all impediments in fancy’s course\\r\\nAre motives of more fancy; and in fine,\\r\\nHer infinite cunning with her modern grace,\\r\\nSubdu’d me to her rate; she got the ring,\\r\\nAnd I had that which any inferior might\\r\\nAt market-price have bought.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI must be patient.\\r\\nYou that have turn’d off a first so noble wife\\r\\nMay justly diet me.

This ring was his of late.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nAnd this was it I gave him, being abed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThe story then goes false you threw it him\\r\\nOut of a casement.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI have spoke the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Attendant with Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy lord, I do confess the ring was hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nYou boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.\\r\\nIs this the man you speak of?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nAy, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nTell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,\\r\\nNot fearing the displeasure of your master,\\r\\nWhich on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off,—\\r\\nBy him and by this woman here what know you?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSo please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman.\\r\\nTricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nCome, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nFaith, sir, he did love her; but how?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nHow, I pray you?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHe did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nHow is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHe lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nAs thou art a knave and no knave.\\r\\nWhat an equivocal companion is this!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nDo you know he promised me marriage?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nFaith, I know more than I’ll speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nBut wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nYes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more\\r\\nthan that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of\\r\\nSatan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in\\r\\nthat credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed;\\r\\nand of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would\\r\\nderive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married;\\r\\nbut thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This\\r\\nring, you say, was yours?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nAy, my good lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhere did you buy it? Or who gave it you?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nIt was not given me, nor I did not buy it.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWho lent it you?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nIt was not lent me neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhere did you find it then?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI found it not.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nIf it were yours by none of all these ways,\\r\\nHow could you give it him?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI never gave it him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThis woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThis ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nIt might be yours or hers for ought I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nTake her away, I do not like her now.\\r\\nTo prison with her. And away with him.\\r\\nUnless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,\\r\\nThou diest within this hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI’ll never tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nTake her away.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nI’ll put in bail, my liege.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI think thee now some common customer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nBy Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nBecause he’s guilty, and he is not guilty.\\r\\nHe knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t:\\r\\nI’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.\\r\\nGreat King, I am no strumpet, by my life;\\r\\nI am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Pointing to Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nShe does abuse our ears; to prison with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nGood mother, fetch my bail.

O, pardon!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO, my good lord, when I was like this maid;\\r\\nI found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,\\r\\nAnd, look you, here’s your letter. This it says,\\r\\n‘When from my finger you can get this ring,\\r\\nAnd is by me with child, &c.’ This is done;\\r\\nWill you be mine now you are doubly won?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIf she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,\\r\\nI’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIf it appear not plain, and prove untrue,\\r\\nDeadly divorce step between me and you!\\r\\nO my dear mother, do I see you living?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nMine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon.\\r\\n[_to Parolles_] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.\\r\\nSo, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee.\\r\\nLet thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nLet us from point to point this story know,\\r\\nTo make the even truth in pleasure flow.\\r\\n[_To Diana._] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,\\r\\nChoose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;\\r\\nFor I can guess that by thy honest aid,\\r\\nThou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.\\r\\nOf that and all the progress more and less,\\r\\nResolvedly more leisure shall express.\\r\\nAll yet seems well, and if it end so meet,\\r\\nThe bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Flourish._]\\r\\n\\r\\n[EPILOGUE]\\r\\n\\r\\n_The king’s a beggar, now the play is done;\\r\\nAll is well ended if this suit be won,\\r\\nThat you express content; which we will pay\\r\\nWith strife to please you, day exceeding day.\\r\\nOurs be your patience then, and yours our parts;\\r\\nYour gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts._\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt omnes._]\\r\\n'"
